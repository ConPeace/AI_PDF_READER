Specifically, we recognize the Lekwungen-speaking people known today as the Songhees and Esquimalt Nations, and that their historic connections to these lands continue to this day. The District is located on the southern tip of Vancouver Island in British Columbia. The City of Victoria borders. The District of Oak Bay wishes to appropriately recognize the pre-incorporation history of the lands the District now occupies and seeks to develop such context in consultation with the Songhees and Esquimalt Nations. Oak Bay’s west boundary, and the District of Saanich lies to the north. Oak Bay is one of 13 member municipalities comprising the Capital Regional District. The University of Victoria is partially located in the District, as is a small portion of Camosun College. Additional community landmarks include other public and independent schools, two golf courses, a marina, a yacht club, and a luxury boutique hotel. Oak Bay is a beautiful seaside community with a population of approximately 18,000, defined by residential neighbourhoods, village centres with local businesses, historic character, a canopy of mature trees, accessible shorelines, and abundance of green space. 4 | Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay 4 | Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay DISTRICT OF OAK BAY | OUR OAK BAY FINANCIAL LEGISLATION, POLICY AND BEST PRACTICES 5 | 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay | 5 FINANCIAL PLANNING LEGISLATION Much of the District’s Financial Planning process is guided by the Community Charter S. 165. The Charter requires the District to adopt a Five-Year Financial Plan Bylaw before May 15 annually. Such a Bylaw must: 1. Set out proposed expenditures, funding sources, and transfers between funds 2. Set policy and objectives related to identified funding sources, distribution of property taxes and the use of permissive tax exemptions 3. Disclose amounts for specific expenditures such as debt interest, debt principal, and capital expenditures 4. Disclose amounts for specific funding sources such as property taxes, parcel taxes, and fees 5. Disclose the use of, and transfer to, specific reserves 6. Council may amend the Financial Plan at any point during the year but will only do so if authorized expenditure limits are likely to be exceeded Balanced budget: Current revenues, including transfers from reserves, must be sufficient to support current expenditures, including transfers to reserves. Expenditures include those of a capital nature and debt principal. Example Balance Budget Revenues Operating expenses Accounting surplus Add: transfers from reserves Less: Capital expenditures Less: Debt principal payments Less: Transfers to reserves Balanced budget: | $1,000,000 (900,000) 100,000 50,000 (60,000) (10,000) (80,000) - Notice that an accounting surplus differs significantly from a budgetary surplus. A balanced budget includes expenditures that are not considered expenses under Public Sector Accounting Standards such as capital expenditures and debt principle payments. FINANCIAL PLANNING POLICY AND BEST PRACTICE The District endorses a budget approach that Staff use to carryout budget deliberations. At the November 12th, 2019 Regular Meeting of Council, Council endorsed a budget approach with the following principals: 1. Service Level Approach: Staff prepare the budget to deliver community services at the standard directed by Council and legislation. Staff do not increase nor decrease service levels unless directed by Council or external regulation. Staff endeavour to describe the financial impact of service level decisions so that Council can be empowered to make service level decisions with all available information. Furthermore, Staff endeavor to fund and deliver services in the most cost-effective manner. Service delivery expectations will be further considered and refined by Council in 2022. 2. Alignment of Funding Sources: Staff recommend aligning expenditure funding sources as follows: • Predictable, stable, and ongoing expenditures should be funded using predictable, stable revenues such • as property taxes and user fees. Infrequent, volatile, or less predictable expenditures should be funded using reserves or debt. This will help avoid steep tax increases for capital expenses or significant operating initiatives. Reserve balances should be maintained with annual budget transfers, so funds are available for large, infrequent expenditures. 6 | Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay DISTRICT OF OAK BAY | FINANCIAL LEGISLATION, POLICY AND BEST PRACTICES BUDGET CORE PROJECTS OPERATING CAPITAL OPERATING CAPITAL PREDICTABLE/STABLE EXPENDITURES → TAXATION, USER FEES INFREQUENT/VOLATILE EXPENDITURES → SURPLUS, RESERVES, GRANTS 3. Carryover of Project Budget: The Five Year Financial Plan authorizes expenditures over the 5 years. Thus, on January 1, 2022 Staff are authorized to continue spending under the Financial Plan Bylaw 2021 - 2025, No. 4792. Projects that were underway in 2021 will continue, and projects authorized to commence in 2022 will begin. Operations are not necessarily paused while the District embarks on adopting a new Five Year Financial Plan. 4. Five Year Expenditure Authorization: Staff endeavor to prepare a Five Year Financial Plan that is as accurate as possible and that reflects Council direction and service-level expectations. In this way, staff work can continue while the Financial Plan is being refined in the first quarter of the year. The 2022 Financial Plan will outline general operations as well as specific initiatives planned for the entire 5 year cycle. Council approval of the Financial Plan Bylaw will be considered endorsement and direction for the listed projects, initiatives and operating expenditures that make up the rolled-up Bylaw totals. 5. Financial Plan Bylaw Transparency: the Financial Plan Bylaw is summarized on a high level to maximize operational flexibility while retaining expenditure authorization. The published Financial Plan document will not form part of the Bylaw but will expand the Bylaw detail for transparency. Financial Plan Bylaw • Legal spending authority • Summarized on a high-level for operational flexibility Financial Plan Document • Minimal legal basis • Expands Bylaw in great detail for transparency and accountability 6. Life-Cycle Costing: Staff will integrate annual life-cycle costs into the Financial Plan when new capital expenditures are approved. Life-cycle costs include the additional operating costs to maintain the asset as well as annualized asset replacement contributions. Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay 7 FINANCIAL LEGISLATION, POLICY AND BEST PRACTICES | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY DISTRICT OF OAK BAY | FINANCIAL LEGISLATION, POLICY AND BEST PRACTICES 7. Revenue from New Development Taxation (NDT): NDT revenue is derived from new buildings or newly subdivided lots and are considered taxation revenue from assessed values that did not exist in the year prior. As the District develops, so will the pressure on existing services and infrastructure required to serve new citizens. The District will use NDT revenue to fund the incremental costs of new development including expanded operating expenses, as well as infrastructure maintenance and replacement. It is recommended that the District not use NDT revenue to reduce the tax burden for existing citizens. The practice of using NDT revenue to reduce the tax burden for existing taxpayers is unsustainable and will result in sharper future tax increases and intergenerational funding inequity.

The District’s “Delegated Authority of Administrative Functions Bylaw, 2004” delegates this authority to specific staff within limits.1 This Bylaw was amended in 2019 to grant this authority to specific Managers, Directors, as well as the Chief Administrative Officer. The District’s purchasing Bylaw refers to a recently adopted (2019) Sustainable Procurement Policy which sets purchasing limits and processes for staff. Additionally, the Policy outlines procedures for asset disposal and emergency expenditures. This Policy complies with Municipal, Academic Institution, Schools, and Hospital (M.A.S.H) sector trade requirements and purchasing case law. 1: Bylaw No. 4239, Delegated Authority of Administrative Functions Bylaw; Special Meeting of Council December 12, 2019 Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay 9 DISTRICT OF OAK BAY | FINANCIAL LEGISLATION, POLICY AND BEST PRACTICES Reserve Fund Bylaw and Reserves and Surplus Policy The Community Charter empowers Council to establish by Bylaw, reserve funds. These reserve funds may not be spent except for the specified reserve fund purposes, as outlined by the Bylaw. Use of funds are authorized via the annual Financial Plan Bylaw. In early 2020, Council adopted the “Reserve Funds Bylaw, 2020”.2 which consolidated the already established reserve funds, and repealed ten historical reserve fund Bylaws in the process. The eight reserve funds specified in this Bylaw include: 1. Machinery and Equipment 2. Fire Machinery and Equipment 3. Heritage 4. Land Sale 5. Park Acquisition 6. Capital Works 7. Alternative Transportation 8. Village Parking * For more information on fund balances and purposes, please see the Capital Plan section of this Financial Plan. The District adopted the Reserves and Surplus Policy in 2018. This Policy outlines general objectives of reserves and good reserve background information. Investment Policy In early 2020, Council adopted the District’s Investment Policy, 2020.3 Wherein section 183 of the Community Charter lists the security types that the District may invest in. These securities include: 1. Securities of the Municipal Finance Authority (MFA) 2. Pooled investment funds under section 16 of the Municipal Finance Authority Act 3. Securities of Canada or of a province 4. Securities guaranteed for principal and interest by Canada or by a province 5. Securities of a municipality, regional district or greater board 6. 7. Deposits in a savings institution, or non-equity membership shares of a credit union Investments guaranteed by a Chartered bank Prior to 2020, the District’s Investment Policy had not been updated since 2004. The 2004 Policy restricted the District’s investments to MFA pooled funds, chartered banks, or Canadian treasury bills. The new Policy sets diversification limits and articulates investment objectives in the following order: 1. Preservation of capital 2. Liquidity 3. Return on investment 2: Bylaw No. 4747, Reserve Funds Bylaw, 2020; Regular meeting of Council January 27, 2020 3: Investment Policy, 2020; Regular meeting of Council January 13, 2020 10 | Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay FINANCIAL LEGISLATION, POLICY AND BEST PRACTICES | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY Asset Management Policy In 2018, Council adopted the District’s Asset Management Policy. The Policy captures Council’s direction regarding asset management practices and infrastructure renewal in the District, with the fundamental aim of an asset management approach focused on the development of a plan, and execution of a framework that delivers sustainable service delivery. Some of the guiding principles found in the Policy include: • Sustainable service delivery • Sustainable service delivery may require innovative solutions, but will leverage lessons learned in other communities * An additional key deliverable of the asset management program will be the creation and implementation of decision-making tools enabling Council to manage infrastructure risk as a core part of capital planning. Expense Reimbursement Policy At the Regular Council Meeting of October 26, 2020, the District adopted its new Travel and Expense Reimbursement Policy. This Policy governs reimbursement for staff travel and accommodation for work-related purposes. The Policy objective is to ensure that travel is properly authorized, care has been exercised to minimize costs, and employees are fairly reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses. Department Budget Transfer Policy At the Regular Council Meeting of October 26, 2020, the District adopted its new Department Budget Transfer Policy. This Policy governs the use of authorized expenditures within department operating and capital budgets. Property Tax Exemption Policy Section 165 of the Community Charter requires the District to set out the objectives and policies related to the use of permissive tax exemptions in its annual Financial Plan Bylaw. The following is an excerpt from the Financial Plan Bylaw 2019, No. 4727: “The objective being to distribute tax burden fairly among properties receiving municipal services, Council makes very little use of its authority to grant permissive tax exemptions. The Policy to date has been to grant permissive exemptions only for land and improvements appurtenant to property already exempted by statute (e.g., churches), portions of municipal land leased or licensed to non-profit organization providing a service complementary to municipal services, and in one case, an institution of childhood learning not statutorily exempt.” Grant in Aid Policy In 2015, a Grant Policy working group was brought together to work on a Policy to provide Council with guidance on the evaluation of grant in-aid applications. Council adopted the Policy in 2015. Some of the Policy’s features can be summarized as follows: • Grants should align with the OCP and Strategic Priorities • Grants should primarily benefit Oak Bay residents • Grants should not subsidize services normally funded by other levels of government • One time grants are given preference over recurring • Grants should not be provided to an individual Whistleblower Policy – Reporting, Investigation, and Protection At the Regular Meeting of Council of February 10, 2020, Council adopted the District’s Whistleblower Policy. The purpose of the Policy is to facilitate the disclosure of wrongdoing that is contrary to the public interest. A Whistleblower Policy encourages a culture where wrongdoing can be addressed quickly and appropriately. 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay 11 DISTRICT OF OAK BAY | FINANCIAL LEGISLATION, POLICY AND BEST PRACTICES ORGANIZATIONAL PROFILE 12 | Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay 12 | Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan V2 | District of Oak Bay ORGANIZATIONAL PROFILE ORGANIZATIONAL PROFILE | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY Department Corporate Services Financial Services1 Police Department Fire Services Community Building and Planning Engineering and Public Works1 2021 FTEs 11.50 8.082 2022 FTEs 11.50 8.58 25.00 28.00 8.10 47.25 25.00 28.00 9.10 47.25 Parks, Recreation and Culture 122.20 130.60 Change - +0.50 - - +1.00 - +8.403 Total 250.13 260.03 +9.90 1: Departments may also fund staffing via cost-recovery and/or capital budgets.

Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay 13 DISTRICT OF OAK BAY |ORGANIZATIONAL PROFILE COUNCIL PRIORITIES AND OTHER INITIATIVES Council Priorities and other initiatives are one-time or infrequent operating projects that do not include capital projects. The initiatives below are a combination of Council-directed priority Initiatives as well as staff recommended initiatives. Initiative progress is recorded and tracked in the Corporate Plan. Initiatives Funding These projects are not integrated into the ongoing operating budget, since taxes and user fees fund the operating budget. Integrating these projects into the operating budget would result in significant tax and user fee volatility, meaning that these projects receive funding through grants and any accumulated surpluses, with no impact to tax rates. Using accumulated surplus to fund expenditures is not generally sustainable since the fund has a finite balance. Legislation prevents the District from budgeting transfers to the accumulated surplus fund, therefore Council exercises discretion when approving the use of accumulated surplus fund. Staff propose that these projects be funded as proposed in the chart on page 18. However, actual completion of these projects—and the related expenditures—will likely carry forward to future years. 14 | Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay 14 | Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan V2 | District of Oak Bay ORGANIZATIONAL PROFILE | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY COUNCIL PRIORITIES The District’s annual budget cycle provides Council with the ability to either confirm or adjust priorities each year. Council’s 2019-2022 Priorities were identified early in 2019 and confirmed on June 10, 2019, January 16, 2020, January 28, 2021, and November 22, 2021. Council’s Priorities are as follows: • Ensure access to diverse housing options within the built environment by reviewing and planning for community needs while reflecting Oak Bay’s unique character • Achieve sustainable service by integrating an Asset Management Program within a long-term Financial Plan • Provide service excellence by optimizing operational effectiveness and fostering public engagement • Enhance and promote quality of life and sense of place by stewarding the community’s history, landscape, culture, and amenities within the context of South Vancouver Island • Demonstrate leadership in fostering community health and resilience by committing to economic, environmental, and social sustainability within the District’s operations and decision-making Each year, Council decides which initiatives to fund to advance priorities. Council’s decisions are then reflected in budget documents, including annual budgets and the Five Year Financial Plan. Upon approval, funded initiatives are listed in the District’s Corporate Plan, which in turn drives departmental work plans. Periodic quarterly updates provide Council with progress reports, thus supporting both transparency and accountability.

Duplexes, triplexes, detached suites (e.g., garden suite, laneway house), heritage home conversions, subdivision of larger lots, and townhouses will be reviewed with the community, through a series of public engagement opportunities. The project will conclude with a final report presented to Council, containing a draft policy, design guidelines, and proposed bylaw amendments (to be implemented subsequently as a separate deliverable) as well as a user-friendly field guide. The project is aligned with Sections 4.3.1 and 4.3.2 of the OCP and is supportive of Council's Priority to "Ensure Access to Diverse Housing Options within the Built Environment" as well as the 2020 Housing Needs Assessment Report. Village Area Plans (2023) This initiative will result in area plans being prepared for the Oak Bay Village/Cadboro Bay Road corridor and Secondary Village areas. The Area Plans will consider opportunities for housing in the form of additional multi- family residential and mixed-use development in the village centres and corridor areas. Plans are proposed for the areas identified, addressing the following: • Housing Policy • Residential Form • Density • Urban Design (building and streetscape guidelines) • Transportation • Servicing • Private/Public Investment This project will support Council’s Strategic Priority to “Ensure Access to Diverse Housing Options Within the Built Environment”.1 Furthermore, the District’s Official Community Plan provides additional policy direction to consider the provision of a range of housing opportunities.2 1: Budget Estimates Committee, April 17, 2019 2: Official Community Plan, 2014, Section 4.3.1 Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay 17 DISTRICT OF OAK BAY |SPECIAL INITIATIVES Comprehensive Zoning Bylaw Update (2024) This initiative will address a range of issues respecting the Zoning Bylaw and the regulation of land use in the District. The update will implement the policy directions provided in the Official Community Plan (OCP), bring the document up to date respecting legislation, best practices, as well as addressing new issues that have arisen since the Zoning Bylaw was updated (No. 3531, 1986). This update will comprise phases of research, review and analysis, draft Bylaw revisions, community engagement, and preparation of a final Zoning Bylaw update for the legislated approvals process. The Zoning Bylaw provides for the permitted use of land in Oak Bay, as well as the conditions related to the use of land, for example: lot size and coverage, height, and yard setbacks. The update is intended to produce a more user-friendly document through content reorganization, use of plain language, and to allow for more simplified interpretation and calculations when applying regulations within zones. Implementation of any new policy directions arising from reviews related to housing options will be included in the updated Zoning Bylaw. 18 | Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay 18 | Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan V2 | District of Oak Bay SPECIAL INITIATIVES | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY SUSTAINABLE SERVICE Sanitary Sewer Master Plan (carry-over) This Master Plan will incorporate an updated sanitary sewer hydraulic model, a growth capacity analysis, as well as a current asset management and capital improvement plan.1 Storm Sewer Master Plan (2022-2023) This Master Plan will incorporate an updated storm sewer hydraulic model, a growth capacity analysis, and current asset management and capital improvement plan. The 2021 Financial Plan approved | $150,000 spending in both 2022 and 2023. The 2022 Financial Plan proposes spending the full | $300,000 in 2022.2 Natural Assets and Green Infastructure Scoping (new) Many of the District’s infrastructure policy objectives outlined in the OCP include the development of stormwater/rainwater management Bylaws (encouraging low impact development), expansion of capital projects (including better creek-side pathways and daylighting), and consideration of the creek as a natural asset. This project would explore incorporating municipal services related to management of natural assets and green infrastructure. The intent would be to complete this work in conjunction with the Storm Water Master Plan.3 Emergency Communications Plan (carry-over) The Province is modernizing the Emergency Program Act and all of the associated processes. The strategic plan for the Oak Bay Emergency Program is to enable the District to keep pace with the subsequent changes to legislated accountabilities. This budget item will be used to update emergency plans and processes, buy equipment and materials, as well as train staff and volunteers at a pace that enables the District to maintain a preparedness level appropriate to its size and responsibilities. It will be used in conjunction with the Program’s associated budget items and external funding opportunities. Facilities Master Plan A strategic Facilities Master Plan that provides a detailed analysis of municipal building conditions, options for replacements or upgrades, as well as potential projects, timelines and costs is being developed. The intent is to create a foundational plan to better manage the District’s facilities as assets, factoring in levels of service, community needs, and Council’s strategic direction. An additional | $14,000 has been added to the budget to allow for the highest priority buildings as identified by the Facilities Master Plan.4 Asset Retirement Obligation (carry-over) In August 2018, the Pubic Sector Accounting Standards Board issued Section 3280. This section comes into effect for the District’s 2022 fiscal year end, providing guidance on how to account for, and report asset retirement obligations (ARO). An asset retirement obligation is the legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible capital asset. The most common example of an ARO is the legal requirement to dispose of a building containing asbestos in an acceptably safe and environmentally friendly way. The District will need to identify all tangible capital assets that meet the ARO definition and estimate the associated retirement costs. 1: Asset Management Strategy, January 24, 2019 Special Committee of the Whole 2: Asset Management Strategy, January 24, 2019 Special Committee of the Whole 3: November 22, 2021 Council Meeting 4: Asset Management Strategy, January 24, 2019 Special Committee of the Whole Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay 19 DISTRICT OF OAK BAY | FINANCIAL LEGISLATION, POLICY AND BEST PRACTICES Facilities Operating Model Development (new) With the exception of Parks, Recreation and Culture, the District does not have a formal facilities management function. Over the years, facility-related work has been carried out piecemeal and reactively. This has resulted in building maintenance issues that have impacted the District’s ability to deliver services sustainably. A new project concept that arose out of the District’s initial Facilities Master planning work was the idea of establishing the requirements for the District to evolve and implement the Facilities Master Plan. The idea is to develop an operating model playbook that defines the following: • People – roles and responsibilities within the team, as well as broader stakeholder and engagement concepts • Process – how a facility's “needs” advances through identification, assessment/categorization (i.e., maintain/replace), options analysis, prioritization, decision making, and funding allocation • Technology and Data – how facility information will be stored, maintained, validated, and used – identify trends and generate insights to inform facility management and capital planning decision-making • Governance and Reporting – how to capture and turn this into consistent reporting and decision making for Council and senior leadership Sidewalk Patio Regulation Review (new) Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the District has been taking advantage of the Provincial Government's Temporary Expansion of Service Area (TESA) authorizations process. The TESAs allowed businesses to follow a temporary permitting process for the expansion of operational footprints and to allow for the service of food/liquor on public property. The Province has now moved to make these service area authorizations permanent, with an updated application process for Provincial approvals. The appropriate final permitting and approvals process remains within the authorities of local governments. Currently, the District does not have a permanent process or set of guidelines in place. Council directed staff to keep the current temporary regulations and practices related to temporary sidewalks and parking stall patios in place until June 1, 2022. Staff will be requesting an extension to this date. Further, Council directed that a more fulsome discussion regarding the use of public space for liquor and food services be referred to Council priorities planning. It is proposed that this project be completed in several stages with the first one focusing on identifying issues and proposing solutions for Council's consideration. A potential second stage would be required in order to prepare a permanent program for implementation. Any public consultation would be part of this second stage. 20 | Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay SPECIAL INITIATIVES | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY SERVICE EXCELLENCE Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Training (carry-over) This initiative will provide training for Council and Senior Management regarding the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. Council and Staff comprehension and compliance with current FOIPPA legislation is critical in daily municipal operations. Human Resource (HR) Plan Implementation (carry-over) The purpose of the HR plan is to ensure that the District of Oak Bay has adequate human resources to meet the District’s strategic goals. It’s about ensuring that we have the right people with the right skills at the right time to deliver on Council’s priorities. It is critical that we position the District of Oak Bay as an employer of choice to attract and retain the best talent to ensure future success and sustainability. The various initiatives of the plan will focus on HR planning, attracting and retaining great staff, as well as promoting performance excellence and a commitment to employee safety and wellness. The HR Plan has the following components and costs: 2021 Budget 2021 Actual 2022 (carry-over) 2023 Budget 2024 Budget 2025 Budget Learning and Development Employee Engagement Performance Feedback and Evaluation - Integrated into operating budget - | $20,000 | $10,000 - | $1,400 | $20,000 | $8,600 - - Health and Wellness Recognition Policy Review Occupational Health and Safety Total - Integrated into operating budget - - Integrated into operating budget - | $14,000 | $20,000 | $64,000 - | $10,000 | $11,400 | $14,000 | $20,000 | $62,600 - - - | $20,000 - - - | $20,000 - - - - Although the District has carried forward project funds for the HR Plan components, it is unlikely that there will be measurable progress on this project in 2022. The Human Resource department is currently over capacity while prioritizing significant operational matters that have primarily included the COVID-19 Pandemic. Records Management (approved in 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan) Records Management is an integral component of municipal operations for legislative and productivity reasons. The current system needs updating to incorporate best practices, improve business processes, and ensure regulatory compliance. This initiative is a multi-year undertaking.1 Network Security Audit (carry-over) The District is entrusted with important and sensitive personal information, and has a legislated obligation to protect this information. Furthermore, the District’s data is a valuable resource supporting the delivery of important community services. This audit will identify potential security vulnerabilities and provide recommendations to ensure the District’s systems are protected to industry standards. Such security audits should be conducted once every 3 years. 1: Budget Estimates Committee, April 17, 2019 Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay 21 DISTRICT OF OAK BAY |SPECIAL INITIATIVES Parking Enforcement Services Review (carry-over) Parking enforcement focuses on the requirements found in the District’s Streets and Traffic Bylaw. The Bylaw traffic infraction fines have not been reviewed in over a decade. It is proposed that Council be given the opportunity to provide governance direction on enforcement policy as well as approach. The scope of this project would include: • Review and modernization of the District’s Streets and Traffic Bylaw; • Review of parking enforcement existing hardware, software and interdepartmental business processes; • Council engagement on enforcement policy and approach; • Council engagement on revenue targets; • Creation of standard operation procedures for parking enforcement. Planning Department Consulting Support (new) Many planning department initiatives are considered high priority in the Council’s priority list. The District has, however, been unable to achieve some of the originally planned timelines. Day to day operations are also experiencing capacity challenges. There were many contributing factors including some staff vacancies in 2021. The District has contracted with professionals, allowing the department to supplement existing staffing in order to maintain momentum on other important departmental initiatives. 22 | Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay 22 | Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan V2 | District of Oak Bay SPECIAL INITIATIVES | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY QUALITY OF LIFE Marina Lease Negotiations (carry-over) The District of Oak Bay’s lease with the Province for the foreshore/aquatic crown lands occupied by Oak Bay Marina expires in December 2022. The Oak Bay Marina’s lease with the District of Oak Bay also expires in December 2022. The District will be undertaking a public, competitive process to determine uses/conditions associated with updated lease(s) for the Oak Bay Marina lands, and will require consulting services to support the process. *NEW for 2022* - Upland Consultation - In the event that negotiations proceed to the point of achieving an Agreement-in-Principle or a signed lease, there may be scope for some elements of site design to be refined following public input. This project would allow for public input into those aspects, within defined parameters, such as physical constraints, negotiated agreements as well as budget. Deer Management Study (new) Staff was advised in January of 2022 that the District’s application for funding under the Provincial Urban Deer Cost-Share Program (2022) was successful. The District was awarded a | $30,400 grant to assist with the | $60,650 project cost. Funding will enable the following work in 2022: • Model urban deer habitat-use and distribution patterns based on collected camera data; • Analyze and compare fawn relative abundance following a second and third year of Immuno-contraceptive (IC) treatment; • Model the urban deer population density for 2021 and 2022 to quantify population-level response after 2-3 years of IC treatment; and • Continue with public education, building on citizen engagement undertaken to date, and to ensure that the community knows what to expect going forward. Parks, Recreation, and Culture Master Plan (2024) The District of Oak Bay has not undertaken the preparation of a comprehensive Parks and Recreation Master Plan that engages the community to understand their specific interests and needs. The District’s Official Community Plan recommends preparation of this Plan given the passion for parks and recreation in the community, and the need for continued upgrading and maintenance of facilities. The project’s deliverables will include: • A community survey to assess existing use patterns, satisfaction, and needs in relation to parkland, sports fields, trails/paths, playgrounds, other park amenities, recreation centres, and recreation programs • An analysis of existing and forecasted demographics and best practices to support the community needs analysis Identification of existing and future community needs for different types and locations of parkland, park • amenities, paths/trails, recreation facilities and recreation programs, considering the needs of people of all ages and abilities • Consideration of the need for upgrading the pool or other amenities at Oak Bay Recreation Centre, potentially in partnership with the School District, to satisfy the needs of students as well as all members of the community.1 Animal Control Bylaw/Dog Off-Leash Policy The scope of this project would include a dogs in parks policy review and broader animal control review including the development of a new, modernized Bylaw. Previously these reviews were planned as separate projects but the Parks, Recreation and Culture department will collaborate with Corporate Administration and Strategic Initiatives to realize operational efficiencies and cost savings. In particular, community engagement can be conducted with one comprehensive process instead of two separate processes. Furthermore, Bylaw development 1: Budget Estimates Committee, April 17, 2019, (2) Official Community Plan, 2014, Section 4.6.1 and 4.6.2] Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay 23 DISTRICT OF OAK BAY |SPECIAL INITIATIVES will be coordinated and comprehensive, thereby avoiding multiple amendments or disjointed purposes. COMMUNITY HEALTH AND RESILIENCE Urban Forest Management – Garry Oak Inventory (carry-over) Information collected, and efforts made to conduct an inventory of the Garry Oak, and associated ecosystems in Oak Bays natural areas parks will assist in the design of trail networks and provide a baseline for measuring success of restoration activities. Accumulated data is extremely useful and will be reported to the provincial and federal agencies to track the overall recovery or decline of rare plant species in both Oak Bay area and Canada’s natural parks. The data will also help establish federal funding priorities for recovery activities such as habitat restoration. CCAWG Recommendation - Coolkit Program (carry-over) The Coolkit program has been developed through the University of British Columbia (UBC) Forestry program to function as a toolkit to engage with community residents. Its focus is on impacting climate change and urban forestry; with an overall intent to engage the community in a conversation around climate action, to lead to positive action on both public and private lands. The program is designed to involve everyone from individual residents, their families, and communities, to organizations and local governments in determining what climate action they should focus on. One core element focuses on urban forestry, however it also includes items such as urban food gardens, home improvements, car-pooling, and other local forms of active transportation. The program is designed to be applicable at the neighbourhood level to achieve the greatest impact. CCAWG Recommendation #4 - GHG Reduction Retrofit Program (carry-over) Recommendation #4 from the District’s Community Climate Action Working Group was to help, “create two separate programs and associated policies to accelerate GHG and energy reductions for the retrofit and adaptation of existing buildings, and for new building construction.” This recommendation is intended to increase energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in both new and existing housing stock. Programs that address new housing stock could include initiatives such as implementing higher levels of the BC Energy Step Code, developing an informational program to promote available rebates and incentives for homeowners, or developing an expedited building permit program. Budget for this project would fund a consultant to design the program, however on-going operational costs for such a program has not yet been integrated into the Financial Plan. 24 | Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay 24 | Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay SPECIAL INITIATIVES | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY Active Transportation Program Options Analysis (new) As a means to set clear objectives related to the development of the District's Active Transportation targets within the Official Community Plan, a program analysis will be conducted that outlines potential options for an Active Transportation program, ranging from status quo funding ( | $200,000 of capital per-year for 5 years), to a significantly expanded program with budget of an additional | $800,000 per year for a 5 year period. A significant portion of this program could be made contingent on successful grant applications. The program analysis would include all costs required to fund the design and construction of an expanded active transportation network, including human capital resources, and will address how to develop the following: • Consultant support for program/project management • Design work for layout, preferred alignments, traffic analysis • Outreach and communications to residents, mechanism and resources to receive feedback • Materials costs and installation, signage etc. • Coordination of implementation to consider ongoing asset / infrastructure replacement This Council priority initiative focusses on the initial options analysis and Council decision-making regarding the scope, cost, and expected outcomes of an expanded Active Transportation program. The funding source to implement the potential results of the options analysis has not been identified by Council and are likely significant. First Nations Truth and Reconciliation (new) This initiative funding would be used to secure a contractor or employee to design and deliver education to District staff and Council members on the history of Aboriginal peoples. This will include the history and legacy of residential schools, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, Treaties and Aboriginal rights, and more. It will also include skills based training in intercultural competency, conflict resolution, human rights, and anti-racism. This position will foster the District being better able to liaise with First Nations communities in order to build strong, long-lasting, and mutually beneficial relationships for multiple purposes and to advance reconciliation efforts. Community Energy Plan - District Operations and Community Emissions (new) This initiative would result in the development of a Community Energy Plan for the District of Oak Bay. The Plan would address District operations as well as opportunities to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and energy use (housing and transportation). Implementing recommendations would require additional funds and be considered a separate project. Council resolved to split this initiative into two separate projects at the November 22, 2021 Council meeting: (1) one plan to address District operations, and (2) one plan to address community emissions. Additional research for the community emissions project is required to develop a better estimate. However, a | $50,000 placeholder for 2023-2024 has been set out in the Financial Plan, alongside related deliverables which need to be confirmed by the incoming 2022-2026 Council. Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay 25 DISTRICT OF OAK BAY | CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL PLAN CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL PLAN — 2021 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The proposed 2022-2026 Financial Plan is summarized as follows: Operating Revenues 2021 Budget | $54.0M 2022 Budget | $52.1M | $Change | $(1.9)M Operating Expenses (41.9)M (44.7)M Transfers from Reserves 16.9M 20.5M Capital Expenditures (21.1)M (18.9)M Debt Principal Transfers to Reserves Total (0.1)M (7.8)M (0.1)M (8.9)M | $- | $- (2.8)M 3.6M 2.2M - 1.1M % Change -3.7% +6.5% +21.2% -10.4% - +13.7% 26 | Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay 26 | Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan V2 | District of Oak Bay CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL PLAN | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY DISCUSSION OF BUDGETARY TRENDS: Revenues: Revenues are budgeted to decrease by | $1.9M or 3.7%. This is largely due to a combination of factors: • Grants (Operating) are budgeted to decrease by | $1.2M due to less use of the COVID-19 Restart Grant. This was a one-time grant provided to the District in late 2020 by the Province. Council elected to use this grant to support revenue losses at the Parks Recreation and Culture (PRC) department. As PRC revenues are rebounding, the District is using less to support operations. Ongoing operating grants such as traffic fine revenue sharing, and small communities grant are forecasted to remain stable. • Grants (Capital) are budgeted to decrease by | $5.2M. Last year the District had applied to the Investing in Canada Infrastructure [grant] Program in support of the Uplands Sewer Separation project. This application was not successful. Ongoing capital grants such as gas tax are forecasted to increase by | $37,000 in 2022. • Property taxes are budgeted to increase by 1.5M or 5.4%. Please see a breakdown of this increase below. • Parks, Recreation and Culture revenues are forecasted to rise by | $2.4M. The department is demonstrating strong demand in its services as capacity limitations have been lifted. Expenses: Expenses are budgeted to increase by | $2.8M (6.5%). Much of this increase (1.4M) is an increase in Parks, Recreation, and Culture (PRC) operating department expenditures which are offset by more than | $2.4M increase in PRC revenues. Special initiative funding has increased by 16.5% as a result of Council priorities setting on November 22, 2021. These projects are funded by accumulated reserve and not directly by taxation. Capital Expenditures: Budgeted capital expenditures have decreased by approximately | $2.2M from | $21.1M to | $18.9M. Most of these expenditures ( | $13.1M) were envisioned in the 2021 Financial Plan for 2022. The additional | $4.9M are largely composed of carry over projects such as Public Works Vehicle purchases, Fire Truck acquisitions, and the Chiller replacement. Reserve transfers: The District is rapidly increasing its utility and tax funded transfers reserve to support forthcoming capital expenditures. The District’s recently published draft Sustainable Infrastructure Replacement Plan (SIR) estimates that | $12.8M is the annual sustainable transfer. The 2022 Financial Plan increases the annual transfer to | $8.8M which is 70% of the recommended | $12.8M. Overall, the Financial Plan results in a 5.4% tax increase, (or | $174 to the median residential property) for 2022: Reason for tax increase: Forced growth Infrastructure (transfer to reserve funding) New staffing to support sustainable service delivery Total | $Amount | $827,700 570,000 150,000 | $1,547,700 Tax increase % 2.91% 2.00% 0.53% 5.44% | $Increase to Median Residential property | $93 64 17 | $174 Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay 27 DISTRICT OF OAK BAY | CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL PLAN PRINCIPLE ISSUES, ECONOMIC FACTORS AND SHORT-TERM RISKS TO THE 2022 - 2026 FINANCIAL PLAN The 2022 – 2026 Financial Plan has been prepared by integrating known economic conditions and existing Council direction. The leadership team have identified several risks that may impact the future financial results as discussed below: 1. Infrastructure Replacement The District’s recently published draft Sustainable Infrastructure Replacement Plan (SIR Plan) estimates that approximately | $297M worth of the District’s assets are past their recommended useful life. The Plan recommends accelerated capital replacement output by 3-5 times per year, estimated to be an additional | $30-60M over the life of this Financial Plan. Council directed the staff return in Q1 of 2022 with options to accelerate capital output to help address the backlog of infrastructure replacement. The District is currently preparing a number of Master Plans, with the Facilities Master Plan near completion. This Plan will outline facilities replacement and capital maintenance recommendations that will significantly impact the District’s Financial Plan. 2. COVID-19 The pandemic had a significant impact on the District’s Parks, Recreation, and Culture (PRC) revenue due to ongoing Government regulations that restricted capacity and reduced overall demand. PRC revenues are rebounding quickly but still fall short of pre-pandemic levels. The 2022 Financial Plan net PRC budget (revenues less expenditures) falls short of the pre-pandemic budget by approximately | $1.4M. This shortfall is currently being offset by use of the COVID-19 restart grant. As the pandemic is still ongoing, PRC revenue and expense forecasts may materially change the forecasts that were prepared to inform this Financial Plan. 3. Oak Bay Marina Lease Negotiation The Oak Bay Marina lease negotiations continues during the writing of this Financial Plan. The results of this negotiation will have an impact on the District’s long-term operating budget and investment in capital services. 4. WorkSafe BC Premiums Worksafe BC premiums continue to rise at a fast pace. Since 2015, the District’s total premium expenditure has risen by | $363,000, or 115% (2015 - | $315,000, 2021 - | $678,000), caused by factors such as a: (1) rise in total employee payroll (2) rapid increase in industry base rates, and (3) high organizational experience rating 5. Workforce Labour Shortages The District is currently experiencing the impacts of workforce labour shortages. Pandemic-related government restrictions on capacities impacted overall demand significantly in 2021. Since then, workforce challenges are impacting recreational revenue to a greater extent than government restrictions. These workforce challenges currently reduce the District’s ability to offer a greater volume of recreational programming. This has had a negative impact on the District’s ability to recover to pre-pandemic recreational financial performance. 28 | Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL PLAN — YEAR OVER YEAR CHANGE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL PLAN | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY 2021 Budget | $28,469,200 2022 Budget | $30,016,900 | $Change | $1,547,700 % Change 5.4% Comment Revenue Property Value Taxes New Construction Property Taxes Boulevard Frontage Taxes Grant In Lieu of Taxes 1% Utility Revenue Property Tax Penalties and Interest -

Municipalities levy property value taxes based on the tax revenue needs set out in their annual budget (Financial Plan). Property value taxes are calculated by applying a set tax rate against the assessed value of a property. Municipal tax rates are annually set by Council, and the assessed values are set independently by BC Assessment. TAX STABILITY, PREDICTABILITY, COLLECTABILITY In most years, taxation revenue is predictable and stable with the District’s tax base being 96% residential. Therefore, disruptions in non-residential assessments would not interfere with tax revenues enough to significantly impact the predictability of tax revenues overall, in fact, a uniform and significant reduction in assessed values would be unlikely to disrupt such revenues. The British Columbia legislated model of property taxation administration is one of the most efficient in the world. Tax revenue collection is highly likely in most cases. The Local Government Act requires the District to commence tax sale proceedings in the cases where 3 years of taxes remain unpaid. Section 250 of the Community Charter writes, “Taxes accrued and to accrue on land and improvements... are a charge that, (a) is a special charge on the land and improvements, (b) has priority over any claim, lien, privilege or encumbrance of any person except the Crown…” therefore, taxes are discharged, at a minimum, when the property changes ownership or during tax sale proceedings. Tax sale proceedings can result in the property being auctioned (although exceedingly rare), which ensures property taxes are highly collectible. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ASSESSMENTS AND TAXATION Municipalities use assessed values to apportion property taxes to individual taxpayers. For instance, if a taxpayer’s assessment represents 5% of the entire taxable assessment base, that taxpayer will pay 5% of the municipal property tax budget. A common misconception is that a significant increase in assessed value will necessarily result in a significant increase in property taxes. It is more important for a taxpayer to consider the assessed value in relation to the average assessment increase. It is possible for one’s assessment to decrease while taxes increase and vice versa. ASSESSMENT CHANGE PROPERTY TAX IMPACT Lower than average assessment increase/decrease Individual % tax increase < Total District % tax increase Average assessment increase/decrease Individual % tax increase % = Total District % tax increase Higher average assessment increase/decrease Individual % tax increase % > Total District % tax increase Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay 33 DISTRICT OF OAK BAY | REVENUE DISCUSSION The 2022 Completed Assessment Roll indicates a 20% average increase in residential assessed properties. The preliminary property tax increase for 2022 is 5.4%. This means that properties with an assessment change above 20% will incur a tax increase greater than 5.4%. Average assessment increase: +20% +17% +18% +19% +20% +21% +22% +23% +24% +25% +26% ▲ +2% +3% +4% +5% +6% +7% +8% +9% +10% +11% +12% Average tax increase: 5.4% NEW DEVELOPMENT TAXATION (NDT) REVENUE New Development Taxation (NDT) revenue is derived from new buildings or newly subdivided lots. In other words, NDT is taxation revenue from assessed values that did not exist in the prior year. Staff have estimated approximately | $100,000 derived from NDT Revenue in 2022 with final NDT numbers available in March, with the release of the revised assessment roll. NDT revenues are currently being set aside to increase the transfer to reserve for infrastructure replacement budget. FIVE YEAR PROPERTY TAXATION FORECASTS The draft 2022 – 2026 Financial Plan forecasts an average tax increase of 4.63% for the 5 years and an average increase of | $163 for 2022 through 2026: Tax increase Tax increase | $to median residential property 2022 5.44% | $174 2023 4.59% | $155 2024 4.24% | $149 2025 4.91% | $181 2026 3.99% | $154 Average 4.63% | $163 Forecasted tax increases are driven by the following factors: | $Increase by cost driver Forced Growth 2022 | $827,700 2023 | $665,700 2024 | $619,500 2025 | $779,900 2026 | $812,800 Infrastructure renewal reserve | $570,000 | $570,000 | $485,900 | $570,000 | $570,000 New staffing Debt retirement/new debt Total | $150,000 | $150,000 | $150,000 - | $0 | $0 | $84,100 | $271,400 - | $0 | $1,547,700 | $1,385,700 | $1,339,500 | $1,621,300 | $1,382,800 34 | Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay REVENUE DISCUSSION | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY % Increase by cost driver Forced Growth Infrastructure renewal reserve New staffing Debt retirement/new debt Total 2022 2.91% 2.00% 0.53% 0.00% 5.44% 2023 2.20% 1.89% 0.50% 0.00% 4.59% 2024 1.95% 1.54% 0.48% 0.27% 4.24% 2025 2.36% 1.73% 0.00% 0.82% 4.91% 2026 2.34% 1.65% 0.00% 0.00% 3.99% | $Impact to median residential property by cost driver Forced Growth Infrastructure renewal reserve New staffing Debt retirement/new debt Total 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 | $93 | $64 | $17 | $0 | $76 | $64 | $17 | $0 | $69 | $54 | $17 | $9 | $87 | $64 | $0 | $30 | $90 | $64 | $0 | $0 | $174 | $157 | $149 | $181 | $154 BOULEVARD FRONTAGE TAXES The District levies a boulevard frontage tax subject to the “Boulevard Frontage Tax Bylaw, 1982”. Properties identified in this Bylaw pay a tax based on taxable frontage. The District’s Park’s crew maintains the boulevards adjacent to these properties. The District has an administrative policy of setting its boulevard tax revenue budget to recover approximately 75% of the boulevard maintenance costs. Boulevard maintenance costs have exceeded budget every year since at least 2017. Staff have increased the boulevard maintenance budget significantly in 2022 to reflect this trend. As such, an increase of the tax will be required. Staff are recommending a 5% per year phased in approach until the 75% ratio is achieved again.

Properties identified in this Bylaw pay a tax based on taxable assessment. Taxes collected from this levy are remitted to the Oak Bay Business Improvement Association (BIA). The Oak Bay BIA exists to promote local member businesses and contributes to the community at large. The BIA’s term expires on December 31, 2024 if it is not renewed with another Bylaw. GRANT IN LIEU OF TAXES Federal Payment in Lieu of Tax: Federally owned properties are generally exempt from taxes pursuant to section 125 of the Federal Constitution Act, 1867. Federal properties may, however, be subject to a payment in lieu of taxes pursuant to the federal Payments in Lieu of Taxes Act. Two such federally owned, tax exempt properties in the District pay a payment in lieu of tax, and they are: (1) Turkey Head Breakwater, and (2) Trial Island Lighthouse. | $1,934 Turkey Head Breakwater | $4,516 Trial Island Lighthouse Federal grant in lieu payments are generally equivalent to the amount of taxation that would have been due had the properties not been exempt. Grant in Lieu of Taxes, University of Victoria: The University of Victoria (UVic) is exempt from taxes pursuant to section 54 of the University Act. The University is situated partially in the District of Oak Bay and partially in the District of Saanich. The Ministry of Advanced Education, Skills and Training distributes an annual grant in lieu of taxes to local governments with universities. The funds are apportioned based on the proportional assessed value of university property within the municipality. The total grant fund budget has not changed in many years, with the actual value of the UVic property within Oak Bay assessed at | $351M. The grant in lieu of taxes is equivalent to approximately 2.2% of the taxation revenue that would be due on | $351M of taxable assessment. The foregone taxes demonstrate the District’s significant investment in post-secondary education. 36 | Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay REVENUE DISCUSSION | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY 1% UTILITY REVENUE Pursuant to Section 644 of the Local Government Act and the Hydro and Power Authority Annual Grants Order, utility companies must pay each municipality 1% of the revenues earned within that municipality in the preceding year. Since this revenue is based on prior year financials and amounts remitted to the District, the budget is very accurate. For 2022, 1% revenues are forecasted as follows: Utility Company Shaw Communications Telus Fortis BC Hydro Total 2021 Budget | $28,300 | $18,500 | $38,400 | $136,500 | $221,700 2021 Actual | $28,346 | $18,507 | $38,443 | $136,486 | $221,782 2022 Budget | $27,300 | $18,200 | $41,200 | $136,700 Change - | $1,000/-3.5% - | $300/-1.6% + | $2,800/+7.3% + | $200/+0.1% | $223,400 + | $1,700/+0.8% MUNICIPAL REGIONAL DISTRICT TAX (MRDT) The Municipal and Regional District Tax (MRDT) is a tax of up to 3% on the purchase of accommodation imposed in specific geographic areas of the Province (designated accommodation areas) on behalf of municipalities, regional districts or eligible entities. The District is a designated accommodation area pursuant to the Designated Accommodation Area Tax Regulation 93/2013. Funds raised by means of the MRDT must be used for a prescribed purpose including tourism marketing and sport hosting marketing. As such, MRDT funds raised in the municipality of Oak Bay are used to fund Oak Bay Tourism. USER FEES Section 194 of the Community Charter enables Council to impose a fee in respect of all—or part of a municipal service. In general, user fees are charged when the benefit of a service accrues to identifiable individuals, and taxes are levied when the benefit of a service accrues broadly to the public. However, Council has the authority to vary the mix and imposition of taxes and user fees as appropriate. Below are some of the user fees that the District levies: Sewer User Fees: The District levies a sewer user fee to recover 70% of the costs to maintain the municipal sanitary sewer conveyance system. The remaining 30% of such costs are recovered by property taxes. The sewer user fee also partially funds an annual transfer to reserve for capital asset replacement and rehabilitation. Sewer user fees are calculated by multiplying the sewer rate by 60% of water consumption for residential properties. Rates are applied to 100% of the water used by properties that are not residential, have mixed use, or have two water meters. Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay 37 DISTRICT OF OAK BAY | REVENUE DISCUSSION Capital Regional District Sewer User Fee: The District levies a user fee to recover 100% of the operating costs related to providing regional sewer service, including the Core Area Wastewater Treatment Plant. This levy has experienced steep increases for a number of years while the Capital Regional District phased in the cost of construction. At the Regular Meeting of Council on November 9, 2020, Council elected to recover the regional sewer operating costs via a CRD sewer user fee and the regional sewer debt and capital costs via a CRD property tax levy. At the time of writing this plan, the 2022 Draft CRD budget envisioned a moderate increase to the Core Area Wastewater Operations budget. Thus the CRD Sewer User Fee was not increased for 2022. Water User Fee: The District levies a water consumption charge and a fixed user fee to recover 100% of the costs related to the provision of retail water. The majority of the costs relate to the purchase of bulk water from the Capital Regional District for distribution to District citizens. The fixed fee recovers 35%, while the consumption fee recovers 65%. For properties with two or less units, the fixed fee is | $0.66 per day or | $240.90 per year. Solid Waste User Fee: The District levies a solid waste fee pursuant to the District’s Refuse Collection and Disposal Bylaw. The solid waste fee funds a myriad of services described below. The District’s solid waste fee revenue exceeds the solid waste division direct costs but also funds solid waste service infrastructure replacement and general District overhead. Solid Waste Division Service Solid Waste 2022 Budget Proportion Service Description | $649,700 39% Bi-weekly curbside pickup and unlimited drop off at depot Organics Garden Waste Program Beach Cleanup | $453,100 | $207,000 | $11,000 28% Bi-weekly curbside pickup 13% Unlimited drop off at depot, compost sales 1% 2-4 clean up crew days per year or 1 sunken sail- boat removal Garden Waste Pickup Week | $108,200 7% One day per week per property per year Recycling Depot Total | $196,700 | $1,625,700 curbside garden waste 12% Unlimited drop off at depot 100% 38 | Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay 38 | Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan V2 | District of Oak Bay REVENUE DISCUSSION | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY GRANTS (OPERATING) The District’s operating grant budget is comprised of the following four main grants: 1. Small Community Grant 2. Traffic Fine Revenue Sharing Grant 3. Climate Action Revenue Incentive Program Grant (CARIP) 4. Project-Related Grants Grant Small Community Grant 2021 Forecast | $145,000 2021 Budget | $150,000 2022 Budget | $145,000 Traffic Fine Revenue Sharing | $233,172 | $210,000 | $220,000 CARIP Project-related Grants | $33,499 | $66,950 | $35,000 | $97,200 | $0 | $0 COVID-19 Restart Grant* | $1,472,400 | $2,557,000 | $1,428,600 Other | $1,700 | $59,100 Change - | $5,000 + | $10,000 - | $35,000 - | $97,200 - | $1,128,400 + | $57,400 Total *This grant was remitted to the District in late 2020. Accounting standards require that the grant be recorded as revenue in 2020. The District has transferred it to reserves for use to offset anticipated 2021 and 2022 Parks, Recreation, and Culture revenue shortfalls. The grant is placed in this chart for transparency, however, it will appear as a “transfer from reserve” in the Financial Plan Bylaw. - | $1,198,500 | $1,951,021 | $1,852,400 3,050,900 Small Community Grant: This grant is an unconditional grant paid by the Province to the District. The formula that determines the grant amount is complex, and is phased out as a community grows. Traffic Fine Revenue Sharing Grant: This grant amount is determined by total Provincial traffic fine revenue collected in the year prior. Oak Bay’s share of the funds is determined by the District’s policing costs as a proportion of the entire Province’s policing costs. CARIP Grant: The CARIP grant was a conditional grant program that provided funding to local governments that signed the BC Climate Action Charter equal to 100% of the carbon taxes they pay directly to support local government operations. In September 2021 the Province announced that 2021 would be the final year of the program. GRANTS (CAPITAL) Gas tax: The Administrative Agreement on the Federal Gas Tax Fund in British Columbia took effect on April 1, 2014. The tripartite Agreement between Canada-British Columbia-UBCM replaced the 2005-2014 Agreement and provides the administrative framework for the delivery of Federal Gas Tax funding to local governments and other recipients in British Columbia over a ten year period (2014-2024). The Gas Tax fund provides predictable, long-term and stable funding to local governments in British Columbia for investment in infrastructure and capacity building projects. The gas tax allocation table sets out funding through 2024. 2019 | $851,133.48 2020 | $816,756.82 2021 | $816,756.82 2022 | $853,872.73 2023 | $853,873.73 2024 | $890,979.58 Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay 39 In 2014 when the new agreement was signed, the eligible project categories expanded significantly, prompting many communities to change their gas tax revenue recognition practice. Previously, all gas tax revenues had been deferred and listed as a liability on the financial statements until used for eligible projects at which time the revenue was recognized. Since use of the funds is less restricted, the common accounting practice is to recognize the receipt of funds as revenue immediately. In fact, the District’s 2018 Audit Findings report recommended this accounting practice (see Special Meeting of Council agenda May 6, 2019). Beginning in 2020, the District changed its budget practice to immediately recognize the receipt of gas tax funds as revenue, with these funds being allocated to the District’s Infrastructure Renewal reserve within the Financial Plan. INVESTMENT REVENUE Investment returns grew considerably from 2015 – 2019 due to two main factors: (1) increased investment balances, and (2) increased money market performance. Approximately 80% of the District’s portfolio had been invested in the Municipal Finance Authority’s Money Market Fund. 2015 Actual 2016 Actual 2017 Actual 2018 Actual 2019 Actual 2020 Actual 2021 Actual 340,809 304,755 357,143 744,099 996,143 831,556 xxxx 174,000 152,000 130,000 140,000 301,500 825,000 562,500 | $35.7M 41.0M 46.5M 54.1M 60.1M 72.2M 0.85% 0.79% 0.97% 1.65% 1.88% 0.85% xxxx xxxx Investment Revenues Investment Revenues Budget Cash & Investment Balance MFA money market return % The investment return budget has been increased by | $100,000 from 2021 to 2022. The economic impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic resulted in a significantly lower yield in the District’s investment funds in 2021. Yields appear to be rebounding moderately. Furthermore, the District has diversified some of its investment funds in higher yielding Municipal Finance Authority portfolios. Investment Returns General Revenue Transfer to Reserve Total budgetary impact 2021 Budget | $562,500 - 449,000 - 113,500 - 2021 Budget | $662,500 - 449,000 - 213,500 - Change + | $100,000 - + (100,000) - Linking investment returns to reserve contributions is crucial for a number of reasons: 1. There is a legislated requirement to ensure investment returns earned by reserve funds remain within the reserve fund. 2. General-revenue linked investment returns can significantly increase tax rate volatility. For instance, 3. should investment returns fall, tax revenues will have to rise to offset the loss. Investment returns from reserve funds are part of the District’s annual, permanent, ongoing funding for infrastructure replacement. 40 | Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay DISTRICT OF OAK BAY | REVENUE DISCUSSION OPERATING DEPARTMENT SUMMARIES Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay | 41 Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay 41 FINANCIAL LEGISLATION, POLICY AND BEST PRACTICES | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY CORPORATE ADMINISTRATION Administration consists of the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO), the Director of Corporate Services (DCS), the Deputy DCS, the Director of Strategic Planning, the Director of Human Resources, a Communications Specialist, the Executive Assistant to the CAO, and the Mayor, (as well as additional administrative support staff).

In previous Financial Plans, the administrative facilities budget had been blended into the corporate administration operating budget. However, for transparency, the operating budget is now being presented separately. This operating budget does not include the facility operating costs of the Police, Fire, Parks, Recreation and Culture, and Public Works facilities. The District owns, operates and maintains several administrative buildings including: the Municipal Hall, 1538 Monterey Ave, 1423 Hampshire Ave, 1531 Hampshire Ave, Tod House, as well as the Oak Marina lands.

The District has made significant progress toward ensuring sustainable asset replacement is supported by permanent, predictable revenue (taxation and utility fees). The District increased annual funding by | $1.3M in 2019, | $1.3M in 2020, and | $500,000 in 2021. The draft 2022 Financial Plan increases annual asset replacement funding by an additional | $1.0M. Overall, this will result in | $11.1M in cumulative funding being set aside in reserves over the course of the current Council term (2018-2022). A decision to increase taxes by 3% in 2019, 3% 2020, 1.9% 2021, and 2.0% 2022 for asset replacement, will result in an additional | $173.M funding over the next 50 years. s n o i l l i M } Total incremental funding of | $11.1M over Council term Asset Replacement Funding Scorecard Asset Type 2022 Annual Funding Total | $Funding Target | $% Target Funding Sustainability Rating Dedicated Funding?

The District has increased capital replacement output significantly over the past 5 years. Capital progress output may be measured in the context of the total size and age of the District’s existing asset inventory. The District will be providing asset replacement output information in its asset management strategy. This information will be integrated into future Financial Plans. Some capital replacement output measures may include: • Physical measurement of assets replaced such as linear or square meters, number of units replaced • Proportion of system replaced • Weighted average ages of asset class • Proportion of asset class beyond recommended useful life • Condition assessment information by asset class This information combined with the District’s forthcoming Infrastructure Replacement Plan will be used to provide options for Council to consider the pace at which assets can replaced. Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay | 75 Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay 75 ASSET CLASS INVENTORY Asset Type Roads Buildings Drainage Information and Assumptions Staff use pavement unit rates to multiply pavement quantities in order to estimate replacement costs. This estimate should be revised once a pavement condition assessment is complete. Staff used recent insurance appraisals to value the replacement cost of our current inventory stock. Staff also considered the Building Asset Management report prepared by Moore Wilson Architects Inc. Staff use annual replacement cost information from the Opus International Consultants 2016 Asset Management report. Costs have been adjusted for inflation but it is possible that rising costs have outpaced inflation. Vehicles and Equipment (Fire) Staff use a detailed apparatus replacement plan to forecast asset replacement costs. Vehicles and Equipment (Police) Staff use a succinct Police vehicle and equipment replacement plan to forecast replacement costs. A more detailed plan is underway. Vehicles and Equipment (General) Staff use a detailed Public Works vehicle and equipment plan to forecast asset replacement costs. Vehicles and Equipment (Rec) A detailed recreation and equipment replacement plan has yet to be developed but is underway. As a result, the estimate above may change significantly. IT Equipment and Furniture Staff have developed a detailed PC and IT network hardware replacement plan to forecast asset replacement costs.

Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay 81 DISTRICT OF OAK BAY | CAPITAL PLAN Individual reserve fund projections are outlined below: Climate Action Reserve The District was a signatory of the BC Climate Action Charter, and under the Charter, the District commits to becoming carbon neutral in corporate operations, measuring and reporting progress and creating more energy efficient communities. As a signatory, the District was eligible to receive 100% of the carbon taxes paid during the year as a rebate. Proceeds from this rebate have been transferred to the District’s Climate Action Reserve since 2012. In May of 2021, the Provincial Government announced that the program would be wrapping up in 2021 with 2020 being the last reporting period. Major Crimes Reserve Annually, the Police Board budgets for a transfer to the major crime reserve. These funds are set aside pursuant to the annual budget request from the Police Board. Fire Machinery and Equipment Reserve Fund The Fire Machinery and Equipment reserve fund was originally established pursuant to Bylaw No. 3773, “Fire Machinery and Equipment Depreciation Reserve Fund Bylaw, 1993”. This Bylaw was recently repealed and replaced by Bylaw No. 4747, the “Reserve Funds Bylaw, 2020”. Money in this fund, and interest earned on it shall only be used for extending the useful life, upgrading or replacement of fire machinery and equipment. Two of the Fire Department’s major pieces of apparatus are due for replacement between 2022-2023: (1) Engine with light rescue, and (2) 75-ft Ladder Truck. These vehicles are expected to cost over | $3.2M. The Fire Machinery and Equipment reserve balance was approximately | $2.1M at the beginning of 2022. As a result of these purchases, the reserve is expected to be negative. Staff intend to temporarily borrow from other reserves in order to fund purchases. Heritage Reserve Fund Money in this fund and interest earned on it shall only be used for land development projects and other capital projects designed to augment land development projects. The principal proceeds in this reserve were generated from the net profit from the Municipality’s development of the Wessex Close subdivision in 1980-81. Machinery and Equipment The Machinery and Equipment reserve fund was originally establish pursuant to Bylaw No. 2074, “Reserve for Machinery and equipment By-law” and Bylaw No. 3773, the “Machinery and equipment Depreciation Reserve”. These Bylaws were recently repealed and replaced by Bylaw No. 4747, the “Reserve Funds Bylaw, 2020”. Money in this fund, and interest earned on it, shall only be used for extending the useful life, upgrading or replacement of machinery and equipment. Much of the District’s fleet is due for replacement—and will be replaced in the next 5 years, however, reserve funding levels are believed to be sustainable for the long term. For further information on the asset replacement funding, please see the State of Asset Replacement Funding section of this Financial Plan. Parks Acquisition Reserve Fund Under the Section 510 of the Local Government Act, an owner of land being subdivided into three or more lots must either provide park land, or pay cash in lieu. Section 188 of the Community Charter requires that such payments are credited to a statutory reserve fund. This reserve fund may only be used for the purpose of acquiring new park lands. 82 | Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay CAPITAL PLAN | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY Capital Works Reserve Fund This reserve fund was originally established through Bylaw no. 3775, the “Capital Works and Equipment Reserve Fund Bylaw”. This Bylaw has since been repealed, and replaced with Bylaw No. 4747, the “Reserve Fund Bylaw, 2020.” The primary purpose of the Capital Works Reserve Fund is to provide a means of financing major repairs or replacement of physical assets while moderating tax increases. Annual contributions for water main replacement and sewer rehabilitation are directed to this reserve, among other transfers. *Note that this fund is consolidated into one balance in the District’s annual public sector accounting standard financial statements. For budgeting purposes, the District has separated the capital works reserve into three funds: general, sewer and water. The District is entering an era of significant infrastructure replacement. As a result, the District’s Capital Works reserve is forecasted to decrease slightly over the next 5 years, despite significant investment annual transfers. Capital Works Reserve funded projects include: Projects Fire Department Projects Marina Foreshore Sanitary Sewer Rehabilitation Water main Replacement Parks and Recreation Other Total Use of Reserve 2022-2026 Total Transfers in 2022-2026 2022 0.7M - 0.1M 0.8M 2.6M 0.2M 0.4M 4.8M 3.0M 2023 - 0.5M 0.9M 0.5M 0.9M 0.4M 0.5M 3.7M 3.2M 2024 0.1M - 0.1M 0.7M 1.0M 1.1M 0.1M 3.1M 3.4M 2025 0.1M - - 0.7M 1.0M 0.7M 0.4M 2.9M 3.6M 2026 - 0.2M - 0.7M 1.0M 0.9M 0.2M 3.0M 3.7M Net Transfers -1.8M -0.5M +0.3M +0.5M +0.7M Alternative Transportation Infrastructure Reserve Fund Section 525 of the Local Government Act permits a local government to collect a payment in lieu of off-street parking as a condition of a building permit. These payments must be placed in a reserve. Such payments were deposited to the City’s Village Parking Reserve, established under Bylaw No. 3631, the “Parking Reserves Fund Establishment Bylaw, 1989”. Subsequent to the establishment of the City’s Village Parking Reserve, legislation was enacted to allow Council to use the reserve for transportation infrastructure supporting walking, bicycling, and public transit, in addition to the provision of new off-street parking. The District then created its Alternative Transportation Infrastructure reserve pursuant to Bylaw No. 4422, the “Alternative Transportation Infrastructure Reserve Fund Establishment Bylaw, 2008”. Infrastructure Renewal Reserve This reserve was established by administrative practice and not by Bylaw. The District established this reserve through budget deliberations in 2017. The City receives approximately | $800k in gas tax funds via the Union of BC Municipalities on an annual basis. These funds are deposited into the infrastructure renewal reserve. In 2019, Council directed that property taxes be increased by 2% so that an annual transfer could be established.

Tod House Trust The Tod House Trust was established to fund repairs to the historic residence at 2564 Heron Street, which was jointly owned by the Municipality and the Province. In 2008 the Province gave its share to Oak Bay, but only “for so long as the land is used for the specific purpose of managing the Tod House Heritage Site”. Correspondence with the Province suggests that if the property use were to change, the District will pay to the Province 50% of the market value of the property at the time that its use changed. The Trust is built up from the net rental revenue. Upland Sewer Separation Gas Tax Reserve Fund The District has accumulated and set aside | $6.1M in gas tax funds specifically for the Uplands sewer separation project. These funds were classified as a liability in the District’s financial statements due to the public nature of the commitment to this specific project until December 13, 2021. At the December 13, 2021 Regular Meeting of Council, Council adopted the following resolutions: “THAT the Gas Tax funds dedicated to the Uplands Sewer Separation Project, found in Note 3 of the District's Financial Statements be disencumbered and be made available for general infrastructure expenditures per the terms of the 2014 - 2024 Community Works Agreement; AND FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to dedicate a portion of its property tax funded Infrastructure Renewal Reserve to the Uplands Sewer Separation Project (subject to Provincial grant approval) in the 2022-2026 Financial Plan.” Subsequent to this resolution, funds in the Uplands Sewer Separation Gas Tax Reserve were transferred to the District’s Infrastructure Renewal Reserve and were made available for general infrastructure renewal. A portion of the District’s other funds in the Infrastructure Renewal Reserve has been dedicated to the Uplands Sewer Separation project in the 2022-2026 Financial Plan. 84 | Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay CAPITAL PLAN | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY DEBT MANAGEMENT FIVE YEAR FORECAST The District may choose to incur debt to finance capital expenditures. The Community Charter and Municipal Liabilities Regulation establishes debt limits for the District. The maximum amount of debt a municipality may undertake is subject to the liability servicing limit. A municipality may not incur debt if the total annual debt servicing cost is greater than 25% of the annual controllable sustainable revenues. Municipal long-term borrowing in BC must occur through the Municipal Finance Authority (MFA), and the financing must be undertaken by the municipality’s regional district. This legislated relationship creates a joint and several-liability between the regional district members. The MFA has the legislated authority to levy taxation on all taxable properties within BC. These factors create a strong institutional, governance framework that helps the MFA retain a triple-A credit rating, and exceptionally lowers borrowing costs on behalf of BC municipalities. When municipalities borrow, principal payments are invested by the MFA. Investment earnings are returned to the borrowing municipality via reduced principal payments. For instance, in 2004, the District borrowed | $4.7M to upgrade the Oak Bay Rec Centre, with debt forecast to be paid off in 2023. Over the 20 years, the District’s debt principal will have been reduced by approximately | $1.86M. These debt principal reductions are referred to as “actuarial adjustments”. In the 2022 – 2026 Financial Plan, the District’s annual controllable sustainable revenues will exceed | $48M, making its annual liability servicing limit approximately | $12M. Annual debt servicing costs are not expected to exceed | $632,800, which amounts to approximately 5.3% of the District’s liability servicing limit. Debt payments including interest and principal for the next 5 years are forecasts as follows: Year 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Beginning Balance New Debt1 End Balance | $Principal | $Interest | $Total Payments | $Actuarial | $1,030,324 | $703,497 | $360,327 | $6,000,000 | $5,818,600 - - 6,000,000 - 5,000,000 | $703,497 | $360,327 | $6,000,000 | $5,818,600 | $10,490,800 142,594 142,594 142,594 181,400 327,800 134,378 134,378 134,378 180,000 305,000 184,233 276,972 200,574 276,972 217,733 276,972 361,400 - 632,800 Unknown | $10,490,800 - 10,163,000 327,800 305,000 632,800 Unknown % Liability Servicing Limit2 2.3% 2.3% 2.2% 3.0% 5.3% 5.3% 1: New debt for Carnarvon Park Building with 30-year amortization, presumed debt interest rate of 2.0% 2: Assumes a 2.5% annual increase to controllable sustainable revenues The SIR Plan estimates that the District will incur | $1.3B in infrastructure replacement costs between 2022 and 2121. Approximately 36% of this (or | $469.7M) is forecasted to occur over the next 25 years. The forecasts indicate that even with rapidly increasing reserve contribution funding, the District will need to incur between | $175M and | $220M to replace its infrastructure between 2026 and 2076. Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay 85 DISTRICT OF OAK BAY | CAPITAL PLAN Approval of the Electors Local governments may undertake long-term capital borrowing through a loan authorization Bylaw. The Bylaw must include the purpose of the borrowing, the maximum amount to be borrowed and the maximum duration of the borrowing; for regional district loans the specific service that the loan relates to must also be specified. All loan authorization Bylaws must receive approval of the Inspector of Municipalities before any borrowing can be done. In most cases, approval of the electors (municipalities) or participating area approval (regional districts) is required before the Bylaw can be adopted. Per the Municipal Liabilities Regulation, approval of the electors is not required so long as the annual cost of debt servicing does not exceed 5% of annual controllable sustainable revenues. It is estimated that the District can issue an additional | $32.5M in debt before exceeding the Approval-free Liability Zone as calculated below: Estimated annual controllable sustainable revenues 5% Highest annual debt servicing 2022-2026 Remaining Approval-free Liability Zone debt servicing available Assumed long term interest rate though MFA Assumed actuarial adjustment capitalization rate | $48.0M | $2,400,000 | $632,800 | $1,767,200 3.0% 2.25% Gross debt required for additional | $1,767,200 annual debt servicing | $32,500,000 86 | Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay 86 | Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan V2 | District of Oak Bay CAPITAL PLAN | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY CAPITAL BUDGET SUMMARY BY DEPARTMENT Capital Expenditures 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Total Corporate Administration Finance and IT Police Department Fire Protection Engineering and Public Works Parks, Recreation and Culture Sewer Utility Water Utility | $265,000 277,000 84,700 4,136,000 6,822,900 3,042,900 927,800 2,964,800 | $120,000 275,000 115,500 50,000 11,923,000 1,473,400 667,500 7,285,400 | $- 297,000 118,000 172,000 7,058,500 1,177,400 680,500 1,119,000 | $- 457,000 133,000 88,300 13,454,400 8,294,000 702,300 1,137,500 | $- 255,000 142,300 400,000 13,401,300 1,920,800 702,300 1,137,500 | $385,000 1,561,000 593,500 4,846,300 52,660,100 15,908,500 3,680,400 13,644,200 Total Funding Sources: Reserves Fees and Charges Grants Taxes Borrowing Total | $18,521,100 | $21,909,800 | $10,622,400 | $24,266,500 | $17,959,200 | $93,279,000 | $17,913,800 | $11,520,400 140,800 4,228,600 20,000 6,000,000 138,000 849,300 20,000 - | $8,423,900 143,600 2,034,900 20,000 - | $12,922,400 | $11,615,100 145,000 6,179,100 20,000 - 145,000 6,179,100 20,000 5,000,000 | $62,395,600 712,400 19,471,000 100,000 11,000,000 | $18,921,100 | $21,909,800 | $10,622,400 | $24,266,500 | $17,959,200 | $93,679,000 CAPITAL BUDGET SUMMARY BY ASSET CLASS Capital Expenditures 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Total Building Vehicle Equipment Road Drainage Land Improvement Sewer Water Total Funding Sources: Reserves | $3,367,000 5,327,300 2,087,800 2,858,400 1,160,000 228,000 927,800 2,964,800 | $1,787,700 552,000 1,442,200 3,818,500 6,186,500 170,000 667,500 7,285,400 | $542,700 338,000 1,155,700 2,991,500 3,575,000 220,000 680,500 1,119,000 | $7,137,800 571,500 1,859,000 3,234,500 9,276,400 347,500 702,300 1,137,500 | $803,000 860,000 1,609,000 3,251,000 9,276,400 320,000 702,300 1,137,500 | $13,638,200 7,648,800 8,153,700 16,153,900 29,474,300 1,285,500 3,680,400 13,644,200 | $18,921,100 | $21,909,800 | $10,622,400 | $24,266,500 | $17,959,200 | $92,499,300 | $17,913,800 | $11,520,400 | $8,423,900 | $12,922,400 | $11,615,100 | $62,395,600 Developer Contributions Fees and Charges Grants Taxes Borrowing - 138,000 849,300 20,000 - - 140,800 4,228,600 20,000 6,000,000 - 143,600 2,034,900 20,000 - - 145,000 6,179,100 20,000 5,000,000 - 145,000 6,179,100 20,000 - - 712,400 19,471,000 100,000 11,000,000 Total | $18,921,100 | $21,909,800 | $10,622,400 | $24,266,500 | $17,959,200 | $93,679,000 Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay 87 DISTRICT OF OAK BAY | CAPITAL PLAN CORPORATE ADMINISTRATION Corporate Administration Capital Plan Capital Purchase/Project EDRM System Website Upgrade (carry-over) Total Corporate Admin Capital Asset Type Equipment Equipment 2022 265,000 2023 - 2024 - 2025 - 2026 - - 120,000 | $265,000 | $120,000 - - - - - - Electronic Document Management System An EDRMS will efficiently and systematically manage the District's electronic and paper documents throughout the life cycle of the document (from creation to destruction).

As the EDRMS project progresses and electronic records are more readily accessible, it will allow the District to reduce the physical space required to store paper documents and physical records, and will keep vital records safe from physical hazards like fire, floods or other damage. Website Upgrade ( | $60K carried forward + new funding requested) The current municipal website is a key tool for citizen communication and public engagement in need of revision. This project would upgrade the website to refresh the look and feel, improve navigation, optimize search capabilities, as well as provide for content management functionality. This project will support communications, service excellence and address a recommendation to invest in the website from the Mayor’s Task Force on Public Engagement. Phase 2 of this project proposes the development of an internal intranet for staff use. Project scoping of phase 2 has not been fully developed. This project has been deferred until 2023, and the project budget has been increased by 60k to in order to accommodate the upgrade of the Parks, Recreation, and Culture website. 88 | Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay 88 | Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan V2 | District of Oak Bay CAPITAL PLAN | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY FINANCIAL SERVICES AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY Financial and ICT Administration Capital Plan Capital Purchase/Project IT Project Management Div Projects Network and Other IT Hardware PC Hardware Replacement Asset Type Equipment Equipment Equipment 2022 170,000 85,000 20,000 2023 170,000 2024 170,000 2025 170,000 70,000 22,000 112,000 35,000 105,000 175,000 2026 170,000 50,000 35,000 IT Master Plan and Security Audit Items Equipment << under review >> Total Corporate Admin Capital 275,000 275,000 297,000 457,000 255,000 IT Project Management Division This division was created in late 2020.

The leadership team will evaluate such options when a business case is prepared in 2022. If option three is recommended, additional ongoing operating funding would be requested prior to implementation. Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay 89 DISTRICT OF OAK BAY | CAPITAL PLAN PC Hardware Replacement The Information Technology (IT) division deploys and maintains over 250 pieces of hardware for over 300 users. This inventory is valued at nearly | $200,000 and does not include printers or network hardware. Staff have established annual reserve contributions so that the financial impact of hardware replacement is not volatile. In 2020, the PC Hardware Replacement program was accelerated, funded primarily by savings in the Network Hardware replacement capital program. This was necessary to support a shift to remote working, as well as security patching, and a unified support model. IT Master Plan As part of the 2019-2022 Council priorities, an Information Technology (IT) Master Plan has been developed. IT is a corporate division whose primary function is to support internal department business processes. The departments deliver external services to the community as directed by Council. The IT Master Plan provides in-depth information related to IT support of District operations. The plan also contains many recommendations that need to be considered by the leadership team. The leadership team is charged with weighing risk versus cost implications for recommending resources in support of Council-directed community services. 90 | Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay 90 | Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan V2 | District of Oak Bay CAPITAL PLAN | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY POLICE SERVICES Capital Purchase/Project Police Vehicle Replacement Police Electric Bikes Police Computer Equipment Replacement Traffic Enforcement Equipment Police Building Repairs Total Oak Bay Police Capital Asset Type Vehicle Equipment Equipment 2022 - 10,000 67,400 2023 70,000 - 2024 70,000 - 2025 70,000 - 30,500 33,000 48,000 2026 70,000 10,800 46,500 Equipment - 5,000 5,000 5,000 5,000 Building 7,300 84,700 10,000 115,500 10,000 118,000 10,000 133,000 10,000 142,300 Police Vehicle Replacement The Police Department maintains a small fleet of patrol vehicles and administrative vehicles.

The primary standards that govern the design, maintenance, performance and replacement lifecycles for motorized fire apparatus are; ULC S515, NFPA 1901 and Canadian Fire Underwriters Survey. Under these standards, Engines and Quints are permitted to operate in a primary capacity for 15 years and have a reserve capacity of 5 years. Thus a 20-year maximum service lifecycle is the industry standard. The 1990 Engine reached the end of its service lifecycle in February of 2010. This Engine is now 10 years past-due for replacement. Consequently, no credit is extended towards the Districts current Fire Underwrite Survey (FUS) Grading. When current procurement and build times within the fire apparatus industry are considered; it is projected that this Engine will not be physically replaced until late 2022. Delaying this purchase will negatively impact the Districts current FUS Grading, ultimately resulting in an increased financial cost of fire insurance for residents, businesses and institutions. Site Preparation: Portable Apparatus Bay (carry-over) This capital budget funds the installation of a leased portable apparatus bay, and the renovation of a 1963 era apparatus bay door. The initial capital funding will be used to prepare for and install the portable apparatus bay while improving the apparatus bay door. After the initial install and renovation, monthly lease payments will require ongoing funding. Leasing a portable apparatus storage bay will create space for a modern 100+Foot Quint that is designed to meet the needs of the community. 92 | Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay CAPITAL PLAN | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY Conceptual Drawing Courtesy of Extreme Portable Buildings The dynamics of the legacy 1938/1962 Oak Bay Fire Department (OBFD) fire station has created apparatus design issues for the past 30 years. Both the 1990 Engine and the 2002 Quint were designed to fit into the station rather than be optimized to serve the community. The fire station is well beyond its useful life cycle however, replacement will take time. The addition of the portable apparatus bay, and renovation of the door will buy the District time to plan for replacement. The current lease option of the portable apparatus bay provides financial flexibility and will allow the District to allocate capital towards the renewal of the fire fleet, which will ensure excellent service delivery. Leasing allows the District to consider the long-term plan for the fire station. The portable apparatus storage carries a number of lease buy out options. C-Can Based Training Prop ( | $100K carry-over + | $200K new funding request) This is a capital project to install a new C-Can Based Training Prop (Prop) near the fire station. The previous Financial Plan factored in the re-purposing of the old Drill Tower. Upon completion of an Engineering inspection conducted by Accuren Industrial Services in November of 2020, the Tower was condemned. Originally, there was hope the re-purposing would lead to some cost savings on a new training structure, unfortunately this is not possible due to years of deterioration from exposure to sea air. Over the past decade there has been a constant increase in the mandatory training requirements placed on firefighters in BC and across the country. These regulations have been further complicated by the fact that Oak Bay Firefighters have seen training spaces and opportunities diminish as the community grows and matures. This business case proposes the purchase of a prefabricated Sea Can Training Structure in order to ensure that Oak Bay Firefighters have a safe, effective and secure training space now—and in the future. The proposed structure is modest, and will meet a significant amount of the Departments training needs. Furthermore, it will provide the Oak Bay Police an opportunity for on-site Tactical Training. It takes into consideration that this training space will be required and incorporated into a new fire station at some point in the future, as it is completely portable. The proposed structure would provide cost-recovery opportunities with the ability to host more training events. The addition of Sea Can Training Props provides a simple, effective, and cost- efficient solution that is both adaptable, and sustainable for the future. Creating this new training space, with a combination of legacy and new materials supports this culture. It will ensure that Oak Bay Firefighters secure a safe, realistic, and adaptable training location for the long-term. Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay 93 DISTRICT OF OAK BAY | CAPITAL PLAN Ladder Truck with Heavy Rescue Capabilities This capital budget would fund the replacement of the 2002 68-foot Quint with a new modern NFPA and ULC compliant 100+ Foot Quint in 2022. The primary standards that govern the design, maintenance/ performance and replacement life cycles for Engines are ULC S515, NFPA 1901 and the Canadian Fire Underwriters Survey. Under these standards, Quints are permitted to operate in a primary capacity for 15 year, and a reserve capacity for an additional 5 years, with a maximum service life cycle of 20 years. This is permitted as long as the prescribed preventative maintenance and performance testing is completed and documented throughout the life of the apparatus. The 2002 Quint will reach the end of its service life cycle in July of 2022. This 2002 Quint is the only Aerial Device serving Oak Bay. Due to the age of the 1990 Engine, the Quint is also the only backup Engine serving Oak Bay. When current procurement and build times within the fire apparatus market are considered, it is likely that this Quint will not physically be replaced until early to mid 2022. Delaying this purchase beyond the 2022-23 budget years could negatively impact the current Fire Insurance Grading and is likely to increase the financial cost of fire insurance for residents, businesses and institutions within the District. The OBFD fleet has not been expanded since 1962. Due to its small size, it simply lacks the capacity to compensate for an Engine or Quint that is reaching the end of its service life cycle. Larger Fire Departments have additional capacity within their fleets to negate this type of compression. The lean nature of the OBFD makes it critical that FUS replacement schedules are judiciously maintained. Compliance with these standards will manage fire insurance costs and protect the community from undue risk and liability associated with operating expired fire equipment. This purchase would result in the current 68-foot aerial ladder truck being replaced with a 100-foot ladder truck. The current 2002 Quint had to be built with a 75-foot Aerial Device in order to accommodate fire station limitations. When the 2002 Quint arrived, it did not fit lengthwise into the apparatus bay. Unfortunately, the solution was to physically cut-down the Aerial Device to make it fit, resulting in a reduced Aerial Device with total length of 68-feet. The net change from 85-feet to 68-feet represented a 20% reduction in the overall reach. The current condition of the fire fleet is such that investment in a new Engine and new 100+Foot Quint to meet community needs—is critical. In order to accommodate the 100+Foot Quint, new apparatus storage is required. The new apparatus storage adds approximately 17.5% in life-cycle costs, but the Quint would have an additional 47% servicing potential. The 100ft ladder would also assist the District in maintaining strong relationships with the three core municipalities of Victoria, Saanich and Esquimalt.

TIC’s provide firefighters the gift of sight in dark and smoky conditions and is arguably the single most important advancement in the global firefighting industry in the past 20 years. TIC’s expedite search and rescue as well as fire attack when seconds count. This Capital Project will allow the OBFD to ensure the replacement of this critical safety equipment and manage health and safety over the long-term. Over the past 20 years the use of lightweight synthetic composites in building construction materials and furnishings has created a fire environment that is extremely challenging. Fires in 2022 do not ‘burn hotter’ than they did in the past, instead todays fires reach peak temperatures more rapidly, generating extremely dark toxic smoke conditions quickly while expediting structural collapse. TIC’s allow firefighters to work efficiently in these extremely dark toxic smoke conditions. TIC technology is constantly advancing, and replacement should occur every 5 years. By reinvesting in state-of-the-art TIC’s the District will be making significant strides towards meeting this evolving threat and optimizing firefighter effectiveness. Gas Detective Protective Equipment Gas Detectors are one of the most effective tools for protecting first responders from unseen and unknown atmospheric hazards. They provide a means of early detection and allow firefighters to take precautionary steps to protect themselves and the citizens they serve. This Capital Project will allow the fire department to ensure the replacement of this critical safety equipment and manage health and safety over the long-term. There is a continual need to actively manage Gas Detectors in order to protect the health and safety of firefighters. Wear and tear on the internal electronic components of Gas Detectors at incidents and during training are major stressors. The electrochemical sensors within Gas Detectors are always “working” as they are constantly exposed to the atmosphere. These factors are compounded when continual advancements in technology render legacy Gas Detectors obsolete, and after 5 years of service, replacement is warranted to ensure reliability and optimum performance. By reinvesting in Gas Detectors the District will be making significant strides towards maintaining this critical safety equipment. The life-cycle costs have been integrated into the District’s equipment replacement plan and will be funded by annual reserve contributions. Fire Hall Building Repairs (new) This capital budget would fund the replacement of the fire apparatus bay door operators as well as the replacement of the air conditioning unit. Replacement of the fire apparatus bay door operators that open and close the heavy wooden bay doors is necessary, as they are past their expected service life, having been installed in the mid 1990's. A failure in one of the door operators occurred in 2021 and forced an emergency replacement. Proactive replacement of the remaining 3 door operators and associated safety equipment is critical to ensure that a high level of reliability and safety is maintained. Replacement of the office air conditioning unit, and purchase of an additional air conditioning unit in the upstairs dorm areas is also included. The office air conditioning unit is currently failing and at the end of its service life. The expansion of air conditioning to the upper-level dorm area allows for a more efficient cooling of the area - eliminating a patchwork of portable air conditioners and fans currently in place. Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay 95 DISTRICT OF OAK BAY | CAPITAL PLAN Electric Pickup Truck This Capital budget will fund the replacement of the 2008 Toyota Camry Sedan (Camry) in 2022 with a new Hybrid or true Electric 4x4 Pick-Up Truck (Pick-Up). The change from a Camry to a Pick-Up is intended to provide the fire department with an appropriate tool for the job. The Camry currently serves as a logistics and on-call duty officer vehicle. The Camry is a medium sized 4-door sedan style passenger car, and it is not well suited for use in the fire service. The Camry does not have an NFPA 1901 compliant lights and sirens safety package. A new Pick-Up would be NFPA 1901 compliant, have added safety features and be much more useful. In addition to the fact that the Camry is not suited for the role that it currently fills, it is starting to show its age. The vehicle is a hybrid but, it is first generation technology and significant repairs to the battery system are looming. By the time of replacement, the Camry will be 15 years old, and it will have an estimated 150,000 to 160,000 kilometers. Furthermore, the lack of an NFPA 1901 compliant lights and sirens package restricts it to non-emergency use. A new Pick-Up will provide a vehicle that is much safer, more effective, able to function post-disaster and contribute towards the Districts environmental stewardship. OBFD staff are currently researching replacement options and anticipate that a true Electric Pick-Up will be available by 2022. Mobile Data Terminals Replacement of existing Mobile Data Terminals on Fire Apparatus as they are at the end of their service life is needed. These Data Terminals provide critical information regarding location, nature and details of emergency calls and are integral to the computerized dispatch of fire apparatus. Technical Rescue Protective Equipment The two primary standards that govern the use, care, and replacement of Technical Rescue Equipment (TRE) are NFPA 1983 and WorkSafe BC Part 32. These standards require that all “soft-goods” be replaced after 5 years of active service. They also require replacement if TRE is physically damaged or contaminated with chemical or biological substances. Soft goods comprises all harnesses, ropes, webbing and anchor straps while hardware represents carabiners, pulleys, belay devices, tripods, stretchers and all the supporting safety equipment. TRE replacement has been integrated into the fire equipment replacement plan and funded by annual reserve contributions. Vehicle-Extrication Protective Equipment Vehicle extrication equipment is a significant expenditure and staff have integrated the equipment into the reserve-funded replacement program. The automotive industry is constantly working to reduce weight and improve the strength of vehicle structural components with the introduction of High- Strength, Low Alloy-Steel and Hydro-Formed Parts yielding significant advancements. Jaws of Life can now become obsolete in as little as 5 years. Scheduled replacement of such equipment is required to meet these challenges. This Capital Project will allow the District to ensure the replacement of this critical safety equipment over the long-term. Fire Hose and Appliance The two primary standards that govern the use, care, and replacement of the Fire Hose and Appliance (FHA) are NFPA 1962 and WorkSafe BC Part 31. These standards require ongoing maintenance and testing. If the FHA is physically leaking or becomes damaged, replacement is typically required. During a pre-budget audit of firefighting equipment in 2019, it was evident that a significant amount of fire hose and appliances were in poor condition, or past the end of its service life cycle. Major renewal of equipment has been prioritized and this is the final step in the 6 year process. 96 | Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay CAPITAL PLAN | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY Personal Protective Equipment (carry-over) Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is the protective ensemble that firefighters wear while responding to fires, vehicle accidents, fire alarms and other calls. Arguably, PPE sees the most wear and tear of any safety equipment in use with firefighters. This Capital Project will allow the District to ensure the replacement of this critical safety equipment while managing safety and risk over the long-term. Within the global firefighting industry, the occurrence of cancer within firefighters has become a significant occupational hazard. If the District is able to prevent a single presumptive firefighter cancer claim the savings are substantial. Such claims can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and can significantly impact WorkSafe premiums for years. Such an illness would have a severe impact on an individual, their family, and the organization. PPE manufacturers are engineering new features into their garments that protect against carcinogens. By investing in these new protective features the District will be making significant strides towards managing this threat. The life-cycle costs have been integrated into the District’s equipment replacement plan and will be funded by annual reserve contributions.

The consultants completed and delivered an assessment to the District in 2020. The assessment identified approximately | $300,000 - | $400,000 in deferred maintenance repairs that were high priority as well as an additional | $400,000 - | $500,000 to conform to heritage conservation best practices. In late 2020, the Province introduced a grant program entitled the Community Economic Recovery Infrastructure Program (CERIP). The program, (which funds 100% of project costs), included a Unique Heritage Infrastructure stream focusing on the conservation, repair, and rehabilitation of cultural heritage infrastructure. The District submitted a grant application, however it was not successful. On July 30, 2021, the Province issued a news release to announce the new, | $30-million 150 Time Immemorial grant program to be administered by the First Peoples’ Cultural Foundation and Heritage BC. The Cultural Heritage Infrastructure stream provides up to | $500,000 for eligible projects. The District submitted an application for this stream in November of 2021. Marina Structural Repairs (carry-over) The District-owned (and leased out) Marina buildings need ongoing maintenance to keep them operational. The Marina facilities are currently leased to Oak Bay Marine Group Ltd. The lease expires at the end of 2022. The District of Oak Bay is currently negotiating a new 30 year lease. A recently completed draft Facility Condition report identifies capital maintenance needs of the facility. Capital maintenance has been deferred until 2023—pending completion of the lease negotiations. Work Order Management Infrastructure (carry-over from 2019) This project was approved in the 2019 Financial Plan but no spending has occurred to date. This capital project will add workstations for the Foremen/Lead Hands in Public Works, including two new workstations, as well as improve existing workstations. Currently, work-order management and maintenance management is conducted using traditional paper-based methods. These paper-based records are then integrated into the computer-based management system, creating an unnecessary duplication of work. This project was deferred as it has become necessary to reconsider workstation orientation as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and may be further deferred accordingly. Facilities Contingency This contingency budget would be used for unexpected capital expenditures. In early 2020 the heaters in the mechanic’s shop failed. It was a 25-year-old heavily-used forced air heater. The system heated the 3-bay garage area, a fabrication shop, and office area. The heater was assessed as unrepairable, resulting in the installation of a new energy-efficient radiant heating system. This system is expected to reduce energy consumption by approximately 50%. Reduced costs stemming from a more efficient energy consumption will exceed the capital cost of the new system over the life of the asset. Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay 99 CAPITAL PLAN | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY DISTRICT OF OAK BAY | CAPITAL PLAN Asset Management Software - Phase 1: Scoping The District's Asset Management practice assessment in 2016 included a significant recommendation to acquire an asset management software tool. The intent of the tool is to better enable the District to follow best practices for asset and maintenance management, including managing asset data, preventative/corrective maintenance planning, tracking, capital works planning, and infrastructure analysis. Council committed | $100,000 in the 2016 budget for this project, but the project was deferred because the new Director of Engineering and Public Works assessed that the project requirements analysis was incomplete. In addition, the Director of Engineering and Public Works assessed that the project would be best completed once some other key asset management program activities were finished. Based on the progress of the Asset Management Program, this project is now considered a fundamentally important linchpin to support further development and delivery of other key Asset Management Program projects. This initiative, as it is currently defined, is limited to Project Definition activities. The full scope and cost of the software tool is not yet defined. Staff are required to devote significant time and effort in 2021- 2022 to identify requirements, develop the scope, likely costs, and make recommendations to Council on appropriate software acquisition. Transportation Safety Improvements This program aims to deliver projects to improve on safety for all road users within the district. Projects delivered under this program include crosswalks, traffic-calming initiatives, intersection improvements, and other safety-related capital works. Pavement Management Program The aim of the Pavement Management program is to develop a sustainable road surface rehabilitation program that achieves a specific service level while maintaining best value for money. The District’s Pavement Management Study, completed in 2013, identified over | $2M of road rehabilitation that would need to occur annually, in order to maintain the pavement conditions identified in that year. Storm Sewer Rehabilitation This program captures the refurbishment or replacement of Storm Sewer Mains that have reached end of service life. Based on asset management program targets, the program gradually increases capital expenditures for Storm Sewer Rehabilitation to | $1.1M per year. The program has been underfunded in recent years: the 2016 budget was | $212,000, the 2017 budget was | $117,000 (funded from reserves) and the 2018 budget was | $265,000. Consistent and predictable funding for Storm Sewer Rehabilitation is essential to ensure that capital projects are done efficiently and with best value for money. This funding commitment allows a more cost-effective planned approach to repairs and rehabilitation, as opposed to a more expensive and reactive approach to repairs. 100 | Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay CAPITAL PLAN | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY Storm Sewer Rehabilitation – New Assets These projects represent either new infrastructure, or project definition studies to identify requirements and preliminary designs/costing for new infrastructure related to the storm drainage system. This budget includes: • A sub-catchment modelling & condition assessment of St. Patrick Pump Station which will determine the requirements related to outfall relocation, and a McNeill Bay erosion project requirement • New storm main assets to be determined by the Engineering Department 2022 Sub-catchment modelling & condition assessment of St. Patrick Pump Station New Storm Main Projects 2022 Total Cost | $30,000 | $240,000 | $270,000 Uplands Sewer Separation (Partially Grant Funded) The Uplands neighbourhood currently has a single sewer system that accommodates both sanitary sewage and storm water flows. During heavy rainfall, the storm water volume exceeds the capacity of the system and a combination of storm water and raw sewage discharges into the shallows ocean waters at the Rutland Road and Humber Road pump stations. Separating combined sewers and eliminating overflows at the Humber and Rutland pump stations is necessary under BC’s Municipal Wastewater Regulation. In October 2016 Council committed to a plan to separate combined sewers in the Uplands. The plan involves constructing approximately 5km of new storm mains, progressively diverting storm water flows from homes and catch basins to the new storm sewers. This plan has the added benefit of reducing the volume of storm water in the sanitary sewer system, enabling the District to take positive steps towards meeting its sewer flow commitments under the Core Area Liquid Waste Management Plan. Refreshed estimates for the project were prepared in early 2022: Humber Construction Rutland Detailed Design Rutland Construction | $8,832,000 | $415,000 | $16,347,300 Class B Class B Class C Total | $25,594,300 The District is preparing a third application to the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Grant Program (ICIP).

Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay 101 Electric Vehicle Stations At the January 30, 2020 Special Meeting of Council, Council asked staff to include an initiative in the 2020 – 2024 Financial Plan to install electric vehicle charging stations. At the January 25, 2021 Regular Council meeting, Council reviewed a number of options and the construction of stations is expected to occur in 2022 Council also resolved to levy a | $1 per hour user fee for the electric vehicle stations to potentially offset life cycle cost for revenue to be reinvested in infrastructure replacement. McNeill Bay/McMicking Point Foreshore Erosion Mitigation This project includes two separate studies identifying options for the mitigation of ocean erosion on McNeil Bay and McMicking Point. The project will incorporate considerations from the new Sea Level Rise Study. Year 2021 2022 2023 Component Project definition, concept planning, public engagement Preliminary and detailed design Construction Amount | $30,000 | $50,000 | $1,200,000 The construction costs are unknown at this time and will be better defined once detailed design is complete. This new infrastructure would require an increase to the ongoing operating budget. Foreshore Infrastructure The natural areas along the foreshore of the District—including Willows Beach, Oak Bay, McNeill Bay and other areas— are extremely popular for walkers. The metal railings used for pedestrian safety in these areas are exposed to the elements, especially salt-water spray, resulting in accelerated corrosion and failure of the railings. As part of an ongoing safety program, the District conducts periodic railings maintenance to refurbish or replace these railings. This annual program also addresses minor repairs to stairs and other foreshore access points. Public Works Vehicle and Equipment Replacement Much of the District’s fleet is due for replacement and will be replaced in the next 5 years, however, reserve-funding levels are believed to be sustainable for the long-term. For further information on the asset replacement funding, please see the State of Asset Replacement Funding section of this Financial Plan. 102 | Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay 102 | Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay DISTRICT OF OAK BAY | CAPITAL PLAN SEWER UTILITY Capital Purchase/Project Asset Type Sewer Sewer Main Rehabilitation & Manhole Replacement Sewer Capital - New Assets Sewer 2022 827,800 2023 517,500 2024 680,500 2025 702,300 2026 702,300 100,000 150,000 - - - Total Sewer Utility Capital Plan | $927,800 | $667,500 | $680,500 | $702,300 | $702,300 Sewer Main Rehabilitation & Manhole Replacement As part of the sanitary sewer asset management, Engineering Services replace or refurbish portions of approximately 100 km of sanitary sewer mains that service the District. These main replacements are typically done as conventional excavations or, if possible, via less disruptive and less expensive trenchless rehabilitation, such as cured-in-place-pipe lining. The aim of this work is to install a new pipe or extend the life span of an existing pipe for another 50-70 years. There are 1,316 sewer manholes or utility access holes. District staff either refurbish, replace, or install new manholes on a regular basis to ensure the sanitary sewer system can be maintained and operated effectively.

The 2022 plan for water main rehabilitation represents a significant increase in output. This change comes in response to the significant backlog of water infrastructure work identified in the District’s asset management work between 2016 and 2019. The Water Master Plan, followed by the staff’s significant work in 2020 to flesh out a more robust capital improvement program for water infrastructure, enables the District to accelerate much needed water main replacements. This acceleration represents the first step in a multi-year program to address the maintenance backlog and sustain the current levels of service for water distribution. The District has 494 hydrants to service firefighting needs. Each year, hydrants are replaced, or new hydrants installed as part of the annual capital refurbishment plan, which falls within the Water Distribution Master Plan. Water Distribution System Remote Monitoring System This project would include the installation of new Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition remote monitoring equipment at the Pressure Reducing Valves at Lansdowne and Middowne stations to properly monitor and control water pressure in several of Oak Bay's pressure zones and identify water losses. This work will include longer-term options analysis and costing for system-wide remote monitoring upgrades. North Oak Bay Pump Station Consolidation and Water Main Upgrades This multi-year project comes from a major recommendation from the Water Supply System Master Plan.

Monterey Building Maintenance This capital budget includes the replacement of exterior and interior lighting, linoleum, automatic front doors, and flooring Monterey Roof This capital budget would fund the removal and replacement of all the roofing, gutter, and downspout systems at the Monterey Recreation Centre. It includes 6-line items in the OBPRC capital plan document scheduled for 2025. The current roofing systems were installed in 2000. A roofing audit in 2013 recommended that the roofing systems be replaced by 2023 if certain conditions were met at the time of report, which they were. By 2025 the systems will have reached their recommended lifespan and be several years past the date recommended in the 2013 report. The current conditions reflect the age, and the gutters require regular checking and repair. Waiting too long results in damage to wood structures underneath leading to a significant increase in costs once exposed. Another key upgrade would be to add tie-in points and guardrails to protect staff and contractors on the roof. Parks Facilities This capital budget includes the Anderson Hill Park kiosk and capital maintenance of Quimper Park washrooms. Carnarvon Park Building Design and Build This project involves demolition of the old building and construction of a new two-story building, as recommended in the Carnarvon Park Master Plan.

Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay 107 DISTRICT OF OAK BAY | CAPITAL PLAN Oak Bay Recreation Centre Chiller This project involves replacement of the chiller—which is a significant piece of the refrigeration infrastructure in the arena. The chiller is at the end of its expected lifespan, and needs to be replaced during an Arena shutdown year. The District was awarded a grant through the Community Economic Recovery Infrastructure Program to cover approximately | $524,000 of the project. Oak Bay Recreation Air Unit This project involves the life cycle replacement of the desert-aire dehumidification system for the pool natatorium at the Oak Bay Recreation Centre (OBRC). Oak Bay Recreation Centre Cardio Equipment Replacement This capital budget fund involves the life cycle replacement of all cardio equipment, which includes treadmills, steppers, stationary bikes (i.e., recumbent), elliptical trainers and hand ergometers. Motor Control Centres This project is the replacement of the Motor Control Centers (MCC) for the OBRC. This is a life cycle project for a system that was installed in 1973. The MCC’s are original equipment and are critical pieces of the electrical distribution system for the OBRC. The equipment has far exceeded its expected life, is deemed obsolete, and does not meet currents standards and codes. The switchgear is worn and does not give correct feedback. Parts are no longer available, requiring costly and time-consuming repairs when equipment fails. The switchgear is not protected from shorting and surging properly, allowing incidents to cause more damage than would be normal. The MCC was thermal scanned in 2021, and although there were only a couple minor issues, the system is so old and fragile that a major event could cause severe damage to equipment and personnel, leading to a long and costly emergency shutdown. Solar System This project would involve the removal, disposal, and replacement of the solar system on the roof above the aquatic area of the OBRC. Ideally the project would replace the existing solar water heating system installed in 1984 with a photovoltaic system to generate electricity, or a combination panel that could generate electricity and hot water if cost effective. The existing system has been re-configured over the years and is currently used as a domestic water pre-heat. It has become quite corroded, leaks large amounts of water, and requires significant regular maintenance for very little return. It has far exceeded its lifespan and some sections are decommissioned because of failure. The surface area it occupies could be put to better use as demands from the facility have changed. 108 | Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay 108 | Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan V2 | District of Oak Bay CAPITAL PLAN | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY Henderson General Equipment This capital budget includes the replacement of a bouncy castle, a boiler, heating circulation pumps, and a water heater.

The District intended on carrying out the resurfacing in summer of 2021. However, the industry has experienced supply shortages which have caused substantial delays in the shipping of the necessary materials to the point where the warranty on the installation and use of those materials would not be honored. The materials must be installed within a specific temperature range, and with a significant stretch of dry weather. Consequently, this project has been delayed until 2022. Henderson/Kiwanis Park Playground Equipment This project involves replacement of the playground equipment at Henderson Park in the same location, using the same footprint. Windsor Playground This project involves replacement of the playground equipment at Windsor Park in the same location, using the same footprint. Lafayette Park Playground Equipment This project involves replacement of the playground equipment at Lafayette Park in the same location, using the same footprint.

For example, when a road is built, the District must then maintain that road and keep it clear of debris. Furthermore, often the community forms an expectation that the capital service will continue in perpetuity, and thus the infrastructure will be replaced at the end of its life. As a result, staff endeavor to present the full life-cycle costs of capital budget items so that Council may consider the entire financial impact of budget approval. Below you will find the new capital items being considered in the scope of this Financial Plan. “New” capital does not include capital expenditures for maintaining or replacing existing capital services. For instance, the replacement of an existing road is not a new capital expenditure because the ongoing operating and maintenance costs of that capital will already be integrated into the operating budget. New capital includes a brand-new capital service or enhancement to existing capital services.

It does not include expenditures made for capital, on debt principal or transfers to or from reserves. Local governments may budget for an accounting surplus or deficit but not a budget deficit or surplus. See the definition of a balanced budget Accrual: An accounting method measuring the financial performance and position of an organization by recognizing economic events when they happen, regardless of when the related cash actually changes hands. For instance, revenue is recognized in the financial statements when earned, not when received. Accumulated Surplus: The accumulated surplus is a pool of accumulated funds resulting from all historical budgetary surpluses. Budgetary surpluses result in funds remaining in accumulated surplus (unappropriated) or transferred to reserve (appropriated). Appropriated: When a fund is appropriated, it is subject to certain restrictions on what the fund can be used for. Approval of the Electors: Approval of the electors is required when a local government decision may have a significant impact on the community over the longer term. Some examples are: (1) Long-term borrowing (loan authorization) for municipalities, (2) Disposal of certain utilities other than a water or sewage system, (3) Exchange or other disposal of parkland, (4) Liabilities under some types of agreement, or (5) Removing the reservation or dedication from property. Approval-free Liability Zone: The approval-free liability zone is 5% of controllable and sustainable municipal revenue. Once the total annual cost of servicing liabilities exceeds the five percent approval free limit, all subsequent borrowing must receive elector approval. Balanced Budget: A Financial Plan where the sum of current revenue, transfers from reserves and debt proceeds, equals the sum of current operating expenditures, debt principal payments plus capital expenditures. Capital Asset: An asset that has physical substance, is used to supply a service, lasts longer than a year and is not for sale in the ordinary course of operations. Capital Expenditure: The expenditure of monies for the purchase or construction of a capital asset. Deferred Revenue: Refers to payments received in advance for services which have not yet been performed. The most common form of deferred revenue in municipal accounting consists of Development Cost Charges that are advanced payments for future capital services needed as a result of growth. 114 | Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay GLOSSARY | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY Financial Plan: This term is used interchangeably with “budget” but will also usually refer to the 5 year budget Bylaw. Forced Growth: costs that the District must incur to continue to provide existing services at the same service level. For instance, collective agreement increases, inflation and contractual increases are forced growth factors. Forced growth is not increases to service delivery costs resulting from elective changes or enhancements to existing programs. Fund: A pool of money set aside for a specific purpose. FTE (Full Time Equivalent): A statistic to compare staffing levels between departments, organizations, or years. It is calculated by dividing the total number of hours that one full-time staff member would work during a year. LGDE (Local Government Data Entry): The LGDE forms provide a standardized financial measure of local government activities over the previous fiscal year. Local governments must annually submit their forms by May 15th to the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing. These forms are a standardized presentation of a local government's financial position and activities, such as assets, liabilities, revenue, expenditures, over the course of the previous fiscal year (based on the audited financial statements). Life-Cycle Costs: Full life-cycle costs refer to the total costs incurred by a piece of capital during the entirety of its useful life. For instance, the full life-cycle costs would include the acquisition or construction cost, maintenances costs, and the cost of ongoing annual repairs and maintenance for continued provision of the capital service. Liability: Liabilities are present obligations a reporting entity has to others arising from past transactions or events, the settlement of which is expected to result in the future sacrifice of economic benefit. Municipal Finance Authority (MFA): The Municipal Finance Authority of British Columbia (MFA) was created in 1970 to contribute to the financial well-being of local governments throughout BC. The MFA pools the borrowing and investment needs of BC communities through a collective structure and is able to provide a range of low cost and flexible financial services to our clients equally, regardless of the size of the community. The MFA is independent from the Province of British Columbia and operates under the governance of a Board of Members appointed from the various Regional Districts within the province. New Construction Taxation Revenue: Taxation revenue that results from taxable land or buildings that were not subject to taxes in the previous year. For example, newly built taxable buildings, previously exempt taxable property, newly subdivided land, or valuation increase due to zoning amendments.

Operating Costs: Expenses which are related to the operation of a business, or related device, component, piece of equipment or facility. Revenue: Income from business services and fees. Reserve Fund: A fund established by Bylaw for a specific purpose. Monies placed in a reserve fund can only be used for the purpose for which the reserve was established. RFP: A Request For Proposal is issued at an early stage in a procurement process, where an invitation is presented for suppliers to submit a proposal on a commodity or service. Service Plans: These plans depict the operating costs/revenues and related performance measures of a District Department. SOFI (Statement of Financial Information): The SOFI is a financial statement prepared pursuant to the Financial Information Act. The SOFI contains audited financial statements, as well as other mandated schedules including the schedule of remuneration and expenses, as well as the schedule showing payments made for the provision of goods or services.

The District uses various funds to account for its revenues and expenditures. The revenue in each fund may be spent only for the purpose specified in the fund. Each fund belongs to one of five categories: general, parks and recreation, sewer, water, or reserve. General funds are used for general government and protective services. Recreational funds are used for the day-to-day operations of the District’s Parks, Recreation and Culture department. Water and Sewer funds are self-financed utilities, except for a general fund contribution to the sewer fund. Both utility funds are used for operating and capital purposes. Reserve funds accumulate revenue and interest that will be used to pay for major capital expenses in future years. All funds, (general, sewer utility and reserves) are accounted for on the accrual basis. Sources of revenue are recognized when earned. Revenue unearned in the current period is reported on the balance sheet as deferred revenue.

Property Value Tax Distribution 2. Permissive Tax Exemptions 3. 1. Funding Sources Schedule “A”, Continued Revenue from Property Value Taxes - Objectives and Policies 1.1. The Municipality has a property tax base within which 97.6% of the value is in the Residential class. The high percentage of Residential value, which by its nature is spread over a very large number of properties as opposed to being concentrated in a single industry or sector, enhances the dependability of the property tax as a revenue source. The higher the proportion of total revenue attributable to the property tax, the more predictable are actual revenues for the year and the lower is the likelihood of a shortfall relative to the budgeted revenue amount. On the other side of the issue, whereas with respect to alternative sources of revenue such as user fees there may be scope for the individual taxpayer to make choices that affect the amount paid, the amount of the value-based tax levy for a parcel of land is something over which the owner has virtually no control. The objective of Council with respect to the property tax, therefore, is to achieve a balance between the revenue predictability that this source provides on the one hand, and the goal of restraining the growth of the property value- based tax burden on the other. Council policy is to use the property tax levy to balance the expenditure side of the budget for each year after examining the potential for sustainable revenues from all other sources. Revenue From Parcel Taxes - Objectives and Policies 1.2. A parcel tax is a tax levy on land, the amount of which is not a function of the assessed value of the land. It can be the same amount for every parcel regardless of size, or it can vary with the area or frontage of a parcel. Only in limited circumstances is a parcel tax an alternative to a property value-based tax. It can only be applied to properties receiving a particular service and cannot be used for the funding of general services. With the property tax taking into account the value of improvements as well as land, there is a higher probability, compared to a parcel tax, that it will be related to ability to pay. The objective of Council with regard to the parcel tax concept is to ensure that its use is fair in light of the actual distribution of the benefits conferred by the service that it is intended to fund. Council policy to date has been to use the parcel tax only to cover part of the cost of maintaining boulevards on a limited number of streets where this service is provided by the Municipality. With the value of the service directly related to the amount of boulevard to be maintained, the parcel tax in this case is based on frontage. Revenue From Fees - Objectives and Policies 1.3. Fees charges for specific services form a large part of the municipal revenue stream, adding approximately another 50% to the amount raised by the property value-based tax levy. The largest component of user fee revenue is that which is generated from the Municipality’s recreation programs. The objective of Council is to ensure that recreation user fee revenues cover all of the direct program costs, and to maximize the coverage of fixed overhead costs as well. 122 | Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay APPENDIX C | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY Council policy is to review recreation user fees annually, against the backdrop of the regional market. Much smaller than recreation fee revenue, but still significant in terms of the property value-based tax increase that would be required to replace it, is the solid waste collection and disposal charge, which is a fixed amount for each collection unit (e.g., a dwelling unit or small business) served by municipal crews. The principal objective, with respect to the use of a solid waste charge rather than the property value-based tax is to avoid double-charging properties that, due to volume and the nature of the equipment used, must contract privately for solid waste collection services. Council policy is to recover 100% of its solid waste disposal and collection costs through the solid waste fee. The Municipality also operates a water distribution system. Its fiscal objective, with respect to the system, is to cover the associated costs on a user-pay basis, and the policy in this regard is to set water consumption rates and connection fees at a level which achieves this goal without any requirement for subsidization from the property value-based tax. The Municipality’s sewer system is also operated as a utility, which has traditionally been funded through the property value-based tax, with minor contributions from connection fees. With large capital costs forthcoming in order to comply with the Capital Regional District’s Core Area Liquid Waste Management plan, along with the Provincial Municipal Sewage Regulation, Council has set an objective of funding a greater portion of sewer utility costs from user fees. With household water consumption closely tied to capacity requirements in the sewer system, Council has determined to raise 70% of its sewer utility costs from a water consumption-based user fee by policy. Revenue From Other Sources - Objectives and Policies 1.4. Revenue in the “Other Sources” class consists primarily of appropriations from internal municipal reserve funds. The proportion of total revenue from this source will vary significantly from one year to the next. The principal objective with respect to the use of reserve funds is to finance capital asset depreciation and avoid the use of such funds to offset ongoing operating costs. The rationale for this being that the latter would not be sustainable in the long-term, and would eventually require a property value-based tax spike. Council policy is to use its reserve funds to finance capital works which, in the main, are not undertaken by municipal crews and which therefore may increase or decrease in the amount of the expenditure budget that they represent without affecting the permanent workforce. Proceeds From Borrowing - Objectives and Policies 1.5. The objective of Council is to maintain its long-term debt servicing costs at a manageable level by replacing infrastructure on an incremental “pay as you go” basis. Council policy is to limit the creation of long-term debt to the financing of large capital projects, which cannot efficiently be undertaken on an incremental basis, or where such an approach would not be adequate to meet requirements with respect to public safety, health or senior government regulations. The objective for short-term borrowing, (less than 5 years) is to maintain the outstanding debt at a relatively constant level so that with the amortization of the debt on a project so financed, further investments in the assets of the Municipality can be made without tax impact. The amount of short- term debt that can be outstanding at any one time is relatively low—pursuant to the requirements of the Community Charter. Projects funded in this manner therefore tend to be relatively small; alternatively, the short-term debt may represent only part of the overall funding package. Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay 123 DISTRICT OF OAK BAY | APPENDIX D Property Value Tax Distribution 2. With non-residential properties representing a very small proportion of the total tax base, taxing other classes at a high multiple of the residential rate would be of relatively small benefit to the homeowner, while imposing a disproportionate burden on business property owners and their commercial tenants. The municipal business tax rate as a multiple of the residential tax rate, therefore, is very low relative to most local governments throughout British Columbia. There is no property in the Industry class, and only a small amount in the Recreation class. The objective of Council is to distribute future property value tax increases equitably among the three main classes of property within the Municipality. The policy is to adjust the tax rate ratios each year so that the increase on the average individual property is approximately the same for each of the main classes. There is one property in the Farm class. The value of the property, however, is in its residential use, and the policy is to set the Farm tax rate so as to produce for that one property a municipal tax levy comparable to what it would have been had it remained in the Residential class and increased in assessed value at a rate comparable to other residential properties in its immediate neighbourhood. Permissive Tax Exemptions 3. The objective being to distribute the tax burden fairly among properties receiving municipal services, Council makes very little use of its authority to grant permissive tax exemptions. The policy to date has been to grant permissive exemptions for land and improvements appurtenant to property already exempted by statute (e.g., churches). These exemptions have also been extended to portions of municipal land leased, or licensed to a non-profit organization providing a service complementary to municipal services, and in one case, an institution of childhood learning not statutorily exempt. 124 | Draft 2022 - 2026 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay APPENDIX D: 2020 - 2022 CONSOLIDATED BUDGETS AND ACTUALS APPENDIX D | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY Revenue Property Value Taxes Boulevard Frontage Taxes Grant In Lieu of Taxes 1% Utility Revenue Property Tax Penalties & Interest Grants (Operating) Grants (Capital) Developer Contributions Investment Income Miscellaneous Revenue Municipal-Regional District Tax Facilities Dept.

$2021 Budget Questionnaire 2021 Summary Report JANUARY 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 1 Summary Report 2 Overview Background Each year, the District of Oak Bay seeks public input to support the annual budget process. Council considers resident feedback when setting, reviewing and revising priorities. The District’s annual budget questionnaire is one of many ways residents can provide feedback. Topics Covered The 2021 Budget Questionnaire asked residents whether they wished to increase, decrease or maintain a variety of District services. The questionnaire included brief, high-level service descriptions so that residents had information on current service levels when providing feedback. As well as asking about service levels, the questionnaire also asked residents for feedback on Council’s priorities and on the District’s COVID-19 response. Timing launched through an online platform The 2021 budget questionnaire was www.connect.oakbay.ca on November 2, 2020 and closed on November 30, 2020. Paper copies were also available at District recreation centres. Responses 320 questionnaires were returned by the deadline. Of those, 287 were completed online and 33 were completed on paper. Responses to paper questionnaires were entered into the online data base by staff and are reflected in the detailed response report. A few responses on paper questionnaires could not be entered due to the manner in which 3 they were answered (directional arrows to other questions, providing detailed comments on closed questions etc.) or due to illegibility. Returns were slightly lower than for the 2020 budget questionnaire (341), which is not surprising given COVID-19 restrictions. Ten responses were from people living outside Oak Bay. Those responses were removed from the analyzed data set. Within Oak Bay, there was an even distribution between North Oak Bay and South Oak Bay responses. Questionnaire respondents differed somewhat from Oak Bay’s population profile. Residents in the 45-64 age group are over-represented while respondents in the 25-34 and 75+ categories are under-represented.

Residents were invited to comment on as many or as few questions as they wanted, so response totals differed by question. While there was no mechanism to prevent individuals from responding more than once, staff deployed checks and balances and did not detect evidence of response stacking. 4 Statistical Significance The questionnaire is not a random-sample survey and cannot be considered statistically significant. The questionnaire does, however, provide an indication of the preferences of those who responded to the questionnaire.

Feedback was requested on the suitability of the portfolio of projects rather than of any individual projects listed. A majority of residents felt that the package of (consisting of many initiatives 6 initiatives for all Council’s priorities was sufficient/appropriate, although initiatives supporting two priorities (Diverse Housing and Quality of Life) were deemed less sufficient/appropriate than the others. With respect to Diverse Housing, there were several comments questioning the need for/value of further studies and pressing instead for action. With respect to Quality of Life, there were many comments relating to deer. Council Priority Sustainable Service Health and Resilience Service Excellence Diverse Housing Quality of Life COVID-19 Response Responding Sufficient/Appropriate 85% 85% 84% 74% 72% Respondents were invited to comment on the District’s response to COVID-19 by answering open-ended questions asking for feedback on up to three things the District did well and up to three things the District could improve upon. Interestingly, the same two themes emerged from both questions -- patio seating/sidewalk expansions and communication. There were those who felt that the District did very well in those areas and those who felt that these were areas for improvement. Residents indicated appreciation for enhanced waste transfer stations. A few residents expressed frustration with matters outside District control (e.g. opening of library, early lack of mandatory masking). Some respondents remarked that they were unaware of the District’s efforts or unable to differentiate the District’s efforts from those of the Province. Next Steps The upcoming budget process will provide an opportunity for Council to consider service adjustments to respond to community feedback. 7

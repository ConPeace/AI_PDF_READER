However | $5.3M of this is due to the Uplands Sewer Separation grant application being declined by the Provincial Government. Therefore, revenues are forecasted to exceed budget by | $800,000 when this item is excluded. Furthermore, revenues from the Parks, Recreation, and Culture (PRC) department are forecasted to exceed budget by approximately | $1.1M. The PRC's net operating cost is forecasted to be | $6.3M which is | $1.5M greater than the budgeted 2019 net PRC operating cost ( | $4.8M).

This forecasted PRC budget surplus reduces the District's need to use the COVID-19 restart grant to offset PRC revenues losses by | $1.1M. The District has budgeted to use | $2.63M of the grant, but will only need to use | $1.5 for 2021.

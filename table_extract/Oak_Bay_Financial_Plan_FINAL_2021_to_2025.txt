Specifically we recognize the Lekwungen-speaking people known today as the Songhees and Esquimalt Nations, and that their historic connections to these lands continue to this day. Oak Bay’s west boundary, and the District of Saanich lies to the north. Oak Bay is one of 13 member municipalities comprising the Capital Regional District. The University of Victoria is partially located in the District, as is a small portion of Camosun College. Additional community landmarks include other public and independent schools, two golf courses, a marina, a yacht club and a luxury boutique hotel. Oak Bay is a beautiful seaside community with a population of approximately 18,000, that is defined by its residential neighbourhoods, village centres with local businesses, historic character, mature tree canopy, accessible shorelines and abundance of green space. All of these features combined make Oak Bay one of the world’s most desireable communities in which to live, work, and play. 4 | 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay DISTRICT OF OAK BAY | OUR OAK BAY FINANCIAL LEGISLATION, POLICY AND BEST PRACTICES 5 | 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay FINANCIAL PLANNING LEGISLATION Much of the District’s financial planning process is guided by the Community Charter S. 165. The Charter requires the District to adopt a Five Year Financial Plan Bylaw before May 15 annually. Such a Bylaw must: 1. Set out proposed expenditures, funding sources, and transfers between funds; 2. Set policy and objectives related to identified funding sources, distribution of property taxes and the use of permissive tax exemptions; 3. Disclose amounts for specific expenditures such as debt interest, debt principal, capital expenditures; 4. Disclose amounts for specific funding sources such as property taxes, parcel taxes and fees; 5. Disclose the use of and transfer to specific reserves. Council may amend the Financial Plan at any point during the year but will only do so if authorized expenditure limits are likely to be exceeded. Balanced budget: current revenues, including transfers from reserves, must be sufficient to support current expenditures, including transfers to reserves. Expenditures include those of a capital nature and debt principal. Example Balance Budget Revenues Operating expenses Accounting surplus Add: transfers from reserves Less: Capital expenditures Less: Debt principal payments Less: Transfers to reserves Balanced budget: | $1,000,000 (900,000) Note that an accounting surplus differs significantly from a budgetary surplus. A balanced budget includes expenditures that are not considered expenses under Public Sector Accounting Standards such as capital expenditures and debt principle payments. 100,000 50,000 (60,000) (10,000) (80,000) - FINANCIAL PLANNING POLICY AND BEST PRACTICE The District endorses a budget approach that staff use to carry out budget deliberations. At the November 12, 2019 Regular Meeting of Council, Council endorsed a budget approach with the following principles: 1. Service Level approach: Staff prepare the budget to deliver community services at the standard directed by Council and legislation. Staff do not increase nor decrease service levels unless directed by Council or external regulation. Staff endeavour to describe the financial impact of service level decisions so that Council can be empowered to make service level decisions with all available information. Furthermore, staff endeavour to fund and deliver services in the most cost effective manner. Service delivery expectations will be further considered and refined by Council in 2021. 2. Funding source alignment: Staff recommend aligning expenditure funding sources as follows: • Predictable, stable, and ongoing expenditures should be funded using predictable, stable revenues such • as property taxes and user fees. Infrequent, volatile, or less predictable expenditures should be funded using reserves or debt. This will help avoid steep tax increases for capital expenses or significant operating Initiatives. Reserves balances should be maintained with annual budget transfers so funds are available for large, infrequent expenditures. 6 | 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay DISTRICT OF OAK BAY | FINANCIAL LEGISLATION, POLICY AND BEST PRACTICES BUDGET CORE PROJECTS OPERATING CAPITAL OPERATING CAPITAL PREDICTABLE/STABLE EXPENDITURES → TAXATION, USER FEES INFREQUENT/VOLATILE EXPENDITURES → SURPLUS, RESERVES, GRANTS 3. Project budget carry-over: The Financial Plan authorizes expenditures over five years. Thus, on January 1, 2021, staff are authorized to continue spending under the Financial Plan Bylaw 2020, No. 4752. Projects that were underway in 2020 will continue, and projects authorized to begin in 2021 will begin. Operations are not paused while the District embarks on adopting a new Five Year Financial Plan. 4. Five-year expenditure authorization: Staff endeavour to prepare a Five-Year Financial Plan that is as accurate as possible and that reflects Council direction and service-level expectations. This way, staff work continues while the Financial Plan is being refined in the first quarter of the year. The 2021 Financial Plan will outline general operations as well as specific Initiatives planned for the entire five-year cycle. Council approval of the Financial Plan Bylaw will be considered endorsement and direction for the listed projects, Initiatives and operating expenditures that make up the rolled-up totals contained in the Bylaw. 5. Financial Plan Bylaw transparency: The Financial Plan Bylaw is summarized on a high level in order to maximize operational flexibility while retaining expenditure authorization. The published Financial Plan document will not form part of the Bylaw but will expand the Bylaw detail for transparency. Legal spending authority Summarized on a high-level for operational flexibility Financial Plan Bylaw • • Financial Plan Document • Minimal legal basis • Expands Bylaw in great detail for transparency and accountability 6. Life-cycle costing: Staff will integrate annual life-cycle costs into the Financial Plan when new capital expenditures are approved. Life-cycle costs include the additional operating costs required to maintain the asset as well as annualized asset replacement contributions. 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay 7 FINANCIAL LEGISLATION, POLICY AND BEST PRACTICES | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY 7. New development taxation (NDT) revenue: NDT revenue is derived from new buildings or newly subdivided lots. In other words, NDT is taxation revenue from assessed values that did not exist in the prior year. As the District develops, so will the pressure on existing services and infrastructure required to serve new citizens. The District will use NDT revenue to fund the incremental costs of new development including expanded operating expenses and infrastructure maintenance and replacement. Staff recommend that the District does not use NDT revenue to reduce the tax burden for existing citizens. The practice of using NDT revenue to reduce the tax burden for existing taxpayers is unsustainable and will result in sharper future tax increases and intergenerational funding inequity.

The District’s “Delegated Authority of Administrative Functions Bylaw, 2004” delegates this authority to specific staff within limits.1 In 2019, this Bylaw was amended to delegate such authority to specific Managers, Directors and the Chief Administrative Officer. The District’s purchasing policy to a recently adopted (2019) Sustainable Procurement Policy which sets purchasing limits and processes for staff. The policy also outlines procedures for asset disposal and emergency expenditures. This policy complies with M.A.S.H sector trade requirements and purchasing case law.2 Reserve Fund Bylaw and Reserves and Surplus Policy The Community Charter empowers Council to establish, by Bylaw, reserve funds. Funds placed in these reserve funds may not be spent except for the reserve fund purpose specified in the Bylaw. Use of funds are authorized via the annual Financial Plan Bylaw. 1 Bylaw No. 4239, Delegated Authority of Administrative Functions Bylaw; Special Meeting of Council December 12, 2019 2 The M.A.S.H. sector includes Municipalities, School Boards, Publicly-Funded Academia, Health and Social Services Entities 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay 9 FINANCIAL LEGISLATION, POLICY AND BEST PRACTICES | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY In early 2020, Council adopted the “Reserve Funds Bylaw, 2020”.3 This Bylaw consolidated already established reserve funds and repealed ten historical reserve fund Bylaws. The seven reserve funds specified in this Bylaw include: (1) Machinery and Equipment, (2) Fire Machinery and Equipment, (3) Heritage, (4) Land Sale, (5) Park Acquisition, (6) Capital Works, and (7) Alternative Transportation. Please see the Capital Plan section of this Financial Plan for further information on fund balances and purposes. The District adopted the Reserves and Surplus Policy in 2018. This policy outlines general objectives of reserves and provides important background information. Investment Policy In early 2020, Council adopted the District’s Investment Policy, 2020.4 Section 183 of the Community Charter lists the security types that the District may invest in. These securities include: (1) securities of the Municipal Finance Authority (MFA), (2) pooled investment funds under section 16 of the Municipal Finance Authority Act, (3) securities of Canada or of a province, (4) securities guaranteed for principal and interest by Canada or by a province, (5) securities of a municipality, regional district or greater board, (6) investments guaranteed by a chartered bank, (7) or deposits in a savings institution, or non-equity membership shares of a credit union. Prior to 2020, the District’s investment policy had not been updated since 2004. The 2004 policy restricted the District’s investments to MFA pooled funds, chartered banks, or Canadian treasury bills. The new policy sets diversification limits and articulates investment objectives in the following order: (1) preservation of capital, (2) liquidity, and (3) return on investment. Asset Management Policy In 2018, Council adopted the District’s Asset Management Policy. The policy captures Council’s direction regarding asset management practices and infrastructure renewal in the District. The fundamental aim of an asset management approach is to create a planning and execution framework that delivers sustainable service delivery. Some of the guiding principles found in the policy include: • Sustainable service delivery may require innovative solutions, but will leverage lessons learned in other communities; • A key deliverable of the asset management program will be decision making tools, which will enable Council to manage infrastructure risk as a core part of capital planning. Expense Reimbursement Policy At the Regular Council Meeting of October 26, 2020, the District adopted its new Travel and Expense Reimbursement Policy. This policy governs reimbursement for staff travel and accommodation in the course of work. The policy objectives is to ensure that travel is properly authorized, care has been exercised to minimize costs and employees are fairly reimbursed for out of pocket expenses. Department Budget Transfer Policy At the Regular Council Meeting of October 26, 2020, the District adopted its new Department Budget Transfer Policy. This policy governs the use of authorized expenditures within department operating and capital budgets. 3 Bylaw No. 4747, Reserve Funds Bylaw, 2020; Regular meeting of Council January 27, 2020 4 Investment Policy, 2020; Regular meeting of Council January 13, 2020 10 | 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay DISTRICT OF OAK BAY | FINANCIAL LEGISLATION, POLICY AND BEST PRACTICES Property Tax Exemption Policy Section 165 of the Community Charter requires the District to set out the objectives and policies related to the use of permissive tax exemptions in its annual Financial Plan Bylaw. The following is an excerpt from the Financial Plan Bylaw 2020, No. 4752: “The objective being to distribute tax burden fairly among properties receiving municipal services, Council makes very little use of its authority to grant permissive tax exemptions. The Policy to date has been to grant permissive exemptions only for land and improvements appurtenant to property already exempted by statute (e.g., churches), portions of municipal land leased or licensed to non-profit organization providing a service complementary to municipal services, and in one case, an institution of childhood learning not statutorily exempt.” Grant in Aid Policy In 2015, a working group was brought together to work on a grant policy that would provide Council with guidance on the evaluation of grant in aid applications. Council adopted the policy in 2015. Some of the policy’s features can be summarized as follows: • Grants should align with the OCP and Strategic Priorities • Grants should primarily benefit Oak Bay residents • Grants should not subsidize services normally funded by other levels of government • One time grants are given preference over recurring • Grants should not be provided to an individual Whistleblower Policy – Reporting, Investigation, and Protection At the Regular Meeting of Council of February 10, 2020, Council adopted the District’s Whistleblower Policy. The purpose of the policy is to facilitate the disclosure of wrongdoing that is contrary to the public interest. A Whistleblower Policy encourages a culture where wrongdoing can be addressed quickly and potentially before reputational damage. It is an important tool in deterring or halting financial wrongdoing. 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay 11 FINANCIAL LEGISLATION, POLICY AND BEST PRACTICES | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY ORGANIZATIONAL PROFILE 12 | 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay DISTRICT OF OAK BAY | FINANCIAL LEGISLATION, POLICY AND BEST PRACTICES ORGANIZATIONAL PROFILE 2021 FTEs Change 2020 FTEs Department 9.00 Corporate Services 7.75 Financial Services** 27.00 Police Department* 28.00 Fire Services 8.10 Building and Planning 10.50 Engineering 35.85 Public Works** 150.00 Parks, Recreation & Culture 3.10 Sewer Utility** 8.80 Water Utility** 288.10 Total *augmented with new agreement for investigation services with the District of Saanich. ** these departments may also fund staffing via cost-recovery and/or capital budgets.

Operating projects do not include capital projects. The Initiatives below are a combination of Council-directed priority Initiatives as well as staff recommended Initiatives. Initiative progress is recorded and tracked in the Corporate Plan. Initiatives Funding These projects are not integrated into the ongoing operating budget since the operating budget is funded by taxes and user fees. Integrating these projects into the operating budget would result in significant tax and user fee volatility. These projects are funded by accumulated surplus and grants and therefore do not directly impact tax rates. Using accumulated surplus to fund expenditures is not generally sustainable since the fund has a finite balance. Legislation prevents the District from budgeting transfers to the accumulated surplus fund. Therefore Council exercises discretion when approving the use of accumulated surplus fund. Staff propose that these projects be funded as proposed in the chart below. However, actual completion of these projects, and the related expenditures, will likely carry forward to future years. The Initiative budget average from 2021-2025 is approximately | $450,000. Historically, the District has returned budget surpluses near this mark. 14 | 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay DISTRICT OF OAK BAY |ORGANIZATIONAL PROFILE COUNCIL PRIORITIES The District’s annual budget cycle provides for Council to either confirm or adjust Priorities each year. Council’s 2019-2022 Priorities were identified early in 2019 and confirmed on June 10, 2019 and again on January 16, 2020. Council’s Priorities are as follows: • Ensure access to diverse housing options within the built environment by reviewing and planning for community needs while reflecting Oak Bay’s unique character; • Achieve sustainable service by integrating an Asset Management Program within a long-term Financial Plan; • Provide service excellence by optimizing operational effectiveness and fostering public engagement; • Enhance and promote quality of life and sense of place by stewarding the community’s history, landscape, culture and amenities within the context of Southern Vancouver Island; and • Demonstrate leadership in fostering community health and resilience by committing to economic, environmental and social sustainability within the District’s operations and decision making. Each year, Council decides which Initiatives to fund to advance Priorities. Council’s decisions are then reflected in budget documents, including annual budgets and the Five Year Financial Plan. Upon budget approval, funded Initiatives are listed in the District’s Corporate Plan, which in turn drives departmental work plans. Periodic quarterly updates provide Council with progress reports, thus supporting both transparency and accountability. 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay 15 ORGANIZATIONAL PROFILE | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY SPECIAL INITIATIVES Diverse Housing Secondary Suites Study (carry-over) Infill Housing - Neighbourhoods (carry-over) Village Area Plans (carry-over) Comprehensive Zoning Bylaw Update Sustainable Services Sanitary Sewer Master Plan (carry-over portion) Sanitary Sewer Master Plan Storm Sewer Master Plan Emergency Plan (carry-over) Pavement Condition Assessment (carry-over) Facilities Master Plan Occupational Disability Claims Management (new) Asset Retirement Obligation Review (new) Service Excellence FOIPPA Training (carry-over) Human Resources Plan Implementation (carry-over) Records Management Emergency Evacuation Plan (new funding source) Fire Master Plan (carry-over) Network Security Audit Utility Billing Process Review (new) Parking Services Review (new) Quality of Life Marina Lease Negotiation (carry-over portion) Marine Lease Negotiation (approved in 2020 plan) Marina Lease Negotiation (new funding) Deer Management Sea Level Rise Study (carry-over) Parks, Recreation and Culture Master Plan Animal Control Bylaw/Dog Off-leash Policy Community Health and Resilience Oak Bay High School Track Resurfacing Grant Urban Forest Management - Garry Oak Inventory CCAWG Recommendation (carry-over portion) CCAWG Recommendation - Coolkit Program CCAWG Recommendation #4 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 | $23,600 120,000 - - 82,200 150,000 - 25,000 95,000 50,000 35,000 30,000 7,800 64,000 45,000 10,000 50,000 30,000 15,000 10,000 84,000 6,000 89,000 84,400 25,000 - - 50,000 25,000 66,000 35,000 20,000 | $- - 150,000 - | $- - - 150,000 - - 150,000 - - 50,000 36,100 - - - 35,000 - - - - - - 60,000 - - - - - - - - 15,000 - - - 150,000 - - - - - - 20,000 35,000 - - - - - - - - - - - 40,000 - - - - - | $- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 31,000 - - - - - - - 159,100 10,000 - - - - - | $- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Total Special Initiatives | $1,327,000 | $496,100 | $395,000 | $200,100 Carry-over Price Change Year Change New Item 16 | 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay DISTRICT OF OAK BAY |SPECIAL INITIATIVES DIVERSE HOUSING Secondary Suite Study (carried over from 2020) The District of Oak Bay is working on a housing framework that considers a wide range of potential housing options to meet current and future community needs. One of these housing options is to allow for secondary suites. The Secondary Suites Study is intended to review the policies and regulations necessary for secondary suites to be permitted in Oak Bay. The Oak Bay Official Community Plan includes content that speaks to developing a policy and regulatory framework to permit secondary suites as a way of providing affordable housing in the community, and Council also included secondary suites in their 2017-2018 strategic Priorities. As a result, the Secondary Suites Study is intended to review the options for secondary suites as one possible form of housing within the community. The study will address key items identified through the process, and provide options that benefit the community and property owners. New policies and regulations will be identified including, for example, possible updates to the Zoning Bylaw. Infill Housing - Neighbourhoods (carried over from 2020) The Infill Housing – Neighbourhoods initiative is intended to identify infill housing opportunities and specific housing options based on housing needs for neighbourhoods. Infill housing forms include duplexes, triplexes, laneway houses, garden suites, as well as heritage conversions. This initiative would develop an approach to provide for identified priority housing needs. Preparation of policy criteria and design guidelines for integration of infill housing in neighbourhoods, together with regulatory (Zoning Bylaw) changes, would inform a community engagement process to consider actions that lead to the addition of more diverse housing options in Oak Bay.1 Village Area Plans (carried over from 2020) This initiative will result in Area Plans being prepared for the Oak Bay Village/Cadboro Bay Road corridor and Secondary Village areas. The Area Plans will consider opportunities for housing in the form of additional multi-family residential and mixed-use development in the village centres and corridor areas. Area Plans are proposed for the areas identified and will address housing policy, residential form and density, urban design (guidance for both building and streetscape design), transportation, servicing, and the economics of public and private investment in these key areas of Oak Bay. This project will support Council’s Strategic Priority “Ensure Access to Diverse Housing Options Within the Built Environment”.2 Furthermore, the District’s Official Community Plan, provides policy direction to consider the provision of a range of housing opportunities.3 1 Budget Estimates Committee, April 17, 2019 2 Budget Estimates Committee, April 17, 2019 3 Official Community Plan, 2014, Section 4.3.1 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay | 17 SPECIAL INITIATIVES | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY Comprehensive Zoning Bylaw Update (scheduled for 2023-2024) This initiative will address a range of issues respecting the Zoning Bylaw and the regulation of land use in the District. The update will implement the policy directions provided in the Official Community Plan (OCP), bring the document up to date respecting legislation, best practices, and also address issues that have arisen over the years since the last version of the Zoning Bylaw (No. 3531, 1986). The Zoning Bylaw update will comprise phases of research, review and analysis, draft Bylaw revisions, community engagement, and preparation of a final Zoning Bylaw update for the legislated approvals process. The Zoning Bylaw provides for the permitted use of land in Oak Bay, as well as the conditions (or regulations) related to the use of land such as lot size and coverage, height, and yard setbacks, for example. The update is intended to produce a more user-friendly document through content reorganization, use of plain language, and to allow for more simplified interpretation and calculations when applying regulations within zones. Implementation of any new policy directions arising from reviews related to housing options will be included in the update to the Zoning Bylaw. HOUSING FRAMEWORK = public input Secondary Suites Infill Housing Village Area Plans Zoning Bylaw Review Housing Need Report 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Complete Staff are recommending an increase of | $50,000 for the Zoning Bylaw update (from | $100,000 total to | $150,000). The increased costs are to fund increased scope for legal review and more robust public engagement.4 4 Budget Estimates Committee, April 17, 2019 18 | 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay DISTRICT OF OAK BAY |SPECIAL INITIATIVES SUSTAINABLE SERVICE Sanitary Sewer Master Plan (2020-2021) This Master Plan will incorporate an updated sanitary sewer hydraulic model, a growth capacity analysis, and up-to-date asset management and capital improvement plans.1 Storm Sewer Master Plan (2022-2023) This Master Plan will incorporate an updated storm sewer hydraulic model, a growth capacity analysis, and up- to-date asset management and capital improvement plan.2 Emergency Communications Plan (carried over from 2020) The Province is modernizing the Emergency Program Act and all of the associated processes. The strategic plan for the Oak Bay Emergency Program is to enable the District to keep pace with the subsequent changes to legislated accountabilities. This budget item will be used to update emergency plans and processes, buy equipment and materials, and train staff and volunteers at a pace that enables the District to maintain a preparedness level appropriate to its size and responsibilities. It will be used in conjunction with the program’s associated budget items and external funding opportunities. Staff are recommending that the project budget be increased by | $5,000 due to an expected increase in consulting costs. Pavement Condition Assessment (carried over from 2020) A Pavement Condition Assessment (PCA) will help the District support its effort for comprehensive asset management and sustainable infrastructure replacement funding. PCAs are utilized by most municipalities to document and prioritize the timely and effective management of road assets. A PCA is comprised of the collection, conversion and entry of roughness and surface distress data via a specialized vehicle. This assessment would encompass approximately 105kms of the District’s paved road network. This project is currently contingent on | $55,000 in grant funding. Facilities Master Plan Building on the work done related to facilities condition assessment, a strategic Facilities Master Plan details timeframes, costs and options for facilities upgrades or replacements. A Facilities Master Plan needs to be developed with decision making options and risk assessment disclosed publicly and allowing for Council to set direction.3 1 Asset Management Strategy, January 24, 2019 Special Committee of the Whole 2 Asset Management Strategy, January 24, 2019 Special Committee of the Whole 3 Asset Management Strategy, January 24, 2019 Special Committee of the Whole 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay | 19 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Secondary Suites Infill Housing Village Area Plans Zoning Bylaw Review Housing Need Report SPECIAL INITIATIVES | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY Occupational Disability Claims Management (new) Annually the District funds (or partially funds) numerous programs, benefits and insurance premiums related to the health and wellbeing of staff including long term disability, annual sick leave, employee assistance program, extended health care and WorkSafe BC insurance. Occupational disability management is the responsibility of management. Disability management must include thorough coordination between employees, management, premium providers, case managers, health care professionals, and unions. Failure to engage in adequate disability management can result in high WorkSafe BC premiums, low employee morale and significant productivity loss. Annually the District pays Worksafe BC premiums to provide insurance coverage for its workers. These premiums represent a significant expense in the District’s operating budget and impact all service areas. Since 2015, the District’s total premium expenditure has risen by | $225,000, or 71% (2015 - | $315,000, 2020 - | $540,000) The increase in premiums is due to several factors. For instance, there have been legislative changes that have widened the scope of WorkSafe BC insurance coverage. Annually WorkSafe BC reports the District’s experiencing rating. This rating is a discount or surcharge based on the District’s health and safety record. The District’s 2020 experience rating was a 36% surcharge. Based on the District’s 2020 WorkSafe BC Employer report, the District is paying an annual surcharge of over | $141,000. Furthermore, the maximum potential savings on premiums is estimated to be | $337,000. This project funds contracted disability management services. The objective of the project is to improve occupational health and safety, reduce productivity loss and reduce WorkSafe BC premiums. The project is proposed on a pilot basis. Staff are optimistic that the project will reduce WorkSafe BC premiums and add ongoing funding to increase disability management capacity from within the organization. Asset Retirement Obligation (new) Section 3280 of the Public Section Accounting Standards was issued by the Public Section Accounting Standards Board in August of 2018. This section is effective for the District’s 2022 fiscal year end. The standard provides guidance on how to account for and report asset retirement obligations (AROs). An asset retirement obligation is the legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible capital asset. The most common example of an ARO is legal requirement to dispose of a building containing asbestos in a acceptably safe and environmentally friendly way. The District will need to identify all tangible capital assets that meet the ARO definition and estimate the associated retirement costs. 20 | 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay DISTRICT OF OAK BAY | FINANCIAL LEGISLATION, POLICY AND BEST PRACTICES SERVICE EXCELLENCE Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Training (carried over from 2020) This initiative will provide training for Council and staff regarding the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. Council and staff comprehension and compliance with current FOIPPA legislation is critical in daily municipal operations. Some training was provided in 2020 and the remaining training funds are being carried forward. Human Resource Plan Implementation The purpose of the HR plan is to ensure that the District of Oak Bay has adequate human resources to meet the District’s strategic goals. It’s about ensuring that we have the right people with the right skills at the right time to deliver on Council’s Priorities. In addition, it is critical that we position the District of Oak Bay as an employer of choice to attract and retain the best talent to ensure future success and sustainability. The various Initiatives of the plan will focus on HR planning, attracting and retaining great staff, promoting performance excellence and commitment to employee safety and wellness.

The current system needs updating to incorporate best practices, improve business processes and ensure regulatory compliance. This initiative is a multi-year undertaking.1 Emergency Evacuation Plan (grant funding declined - Council approval needed) In 2020, the Oak Bay Emergency Program submitted a grant application to the Community Emergency Preparedness Fund for its participation in a regional evacuation route planning project. The grant application was not approved since previous applications have already been awarded to the District. The District would like to proceed with the project to develop a regional emergency evacuation route. The District would lead the project and has garnered support from regional and First Nations partners. Fire Master Plan (carried over from 2020) A Fire Master Plan will provide the District with a holistic platform that goes well beyond the Fire Underwriters Survey and the traditional Oak Bay Fire Department Strategic Plan. In order to develop such a plan the District would need to secure the services of a consulting firm. Such a firm must have extensive experience in fire and emergency services, as well as corporate planning, governance, organizational issues, law and communications. The key output from the consulting team would be the ability to connect fire services and community needs with the greater Capital Region fire operational and political context. 1 Budget Estimates Committee, April 17, 2019 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay | 21 SPECIAL INITIATIVES | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY Network Security Audit (new for 2021 & 2024) The District is entrusted with important and sensitive personal information and has a legislated obligation to protect this information. Furthermore, the District’s data is a valuable resource which supports the delivery of important community services. This audit will identify potential security vulnerabilities and provide recommendations to ensure the District’s systems are protected to industry standards. Such a security audit should be conducted once every three years. Utility Billing Process Review (new) The scope of this project would include: • Review and modernization of the District’s Water Rates, Sewer User Charges, and Refuse Collection and Bylaw, • Review of utility billing processes including existing hardware, software and interdepartmental business processes, • Review of external utility billing services, and • Creation of standard operation procedures and formal billing policies. Staff feel that existing technology could be better leveraged for more efficient services. Furthermore there is opportunity for greater interdepartmental cooperation and more equitable billing practices. Parking Enforcement Services Review (new) In 2020, the District refocused its parking enforcement services on educational objectives. The District recognized that parking patterns changed in the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Parking enforcement focuses mainly on the requirements found in the District’s Streets and Traffic Bylaw. The traffic infraction fines have not been reviewed in over a decade. Furthermore, Council should be given the opportunity to provide governance direction on enforcement policy and approach. The scope of this project would include: • Review and modernization of the District’s Streets and Traffic Bylaw; • Review of parking enforcement existing hardware, software and interdepartmental business processes; • Council engagement on enforcement policy and approach; • Council engagement on revenue targets; • Creation of standard operation procedures for parking enforcement. 22 | 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay DISTRICT OF OAK BAY |SPECIAL INITIATIVES QUALITY OF LIFE Marina Lease Negotiations The District of Oak Bay’s lease with the Province for the foreshore/aquatic crown lands occupied by Oak Bay Marina expires and Oak Bay Marina’s lease with the District of Oak Bay expires in December 2022. The District is undertaking a public, competitive process to determine uses/conditions associated with updated lease(s) for the Oak Bay Marina lands and will require consulting services, as detailed below, to support the process. 2020 carry-over Project funding carried over from 2020 2020 Total 2021 Public input on proposals New Funding 2021 Total 2022 Lease Bylaw legal review & preparation Lease transition plan Contingency 2022 Total Cost | $84,000 | $84,000 Cost | $6,000 | $89,000 | $95,000 Cost | $30,000 | $20,000 | $10,000 | $60,000 Deer Management (New for 2021) The District of Oak Bay and the Urban Wildlife Stewardship Society (UWSS) have partnered to implement a scientifically-based urban deer management strategy for Oak Bay. The UWSS has made significant progress over the past three years working with the District, scientific community, the Province of BC and other stakeholders. Until 2019, the majority of work was focused on strategies for studying deer populations, densities, space use, habitat selection, distribution and movement patterns, equipment acquisition and approvals by senior governments of immuno-contraception methods. In 2019, the emphasis shifted to initiating immuno-contraceptive field work. The Province provided a grant in the amount of | $31,560 which was matched by the District of Oak Bay.

In 2021, District staff will be presenting the information to Council as part of next steps to develop implementation measures to address climate change, and specifically sea level rise as warranted by the results of the sea level rise mapping project. Parks, Recreation, and Culture Master Plan (deferred) To date, the District of Oak Bay has not undertaken the preparation of a comprehensive Parks and Recreation Master Plan that engages the community to understand their specific interests and needs.1 The District’s Official Community Plan recommends preparation of this plan given the passion for parks and recreation in the community, and the need for continued upgrading and maintenance of facilities.2 The project’s deliverables will include: • A community survey to assess existing use patterns, satisfaction and needs in relation to parkland, sports fields, trails/paths, playgrounds, other park amenities, recreation centres, and recreation programs. • An analysis of existing and forecasted demographics and best practices to support the needs analysis. • Identification of existing and future community needs for different types and locations of parkland, park amenities, paths/trails, recreation facilities and recreation programs, considering the needs of people of all ages and abilities. • Consideration of the need for upgrading the pool or other amenities at Oak Bay Recreation Centre, potentially in partnership with the School District, to satisfy the needs of students as well as all members of the community. Animal Control Bylaw/Dog Off-Leash Policy The scope of this project would include a dogs in parks policy review and broader animal control review including the development of a new, modernized bylaw. Previously these reviews were planned as separate projects but the Parks, Recreation and Culture department will collaborate with Corporate Administration and Strategic Initiatives to realize operational efficiencies and cost savings. In particular, community engagement can be conducted with one comprehensive process instead of two separate processes. Furthermore, bylaw development will be coordinated and comprehensive, thereby avoiding multiple amendments or disjointed purposes. 1 Budget Estimates Committee, April 17, 2019 2 Official Community Plan, 2014, Section 4.6.1 & 4.5 24 | 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay DISTRICT OF OAK BAY |SPECIAL INITIATIVES COMMUNITY HEALTH AND RESILIENCE Urban Forest Management – Garry Oak Inventory The information collected by inventorying the Garry Oak and associated ecosystems in Oak Bay's natural area parks will be useful in designing trail networks and will provide a baseline for measuring success of our restoration activities. The collected data is extremely useful and will be reported to the Provincial and Federal agencies to track the overall recovery or decline of rare plant species in Canada and in Oak Bay's natural area parks. The data will also help establish Federal funding Priorities for recovery activities such as habitat restoration. Coolkit Program The Coolkit program has been developed through the University of British Columbia (UBC) Forestry program. Developed as a toolkit for engaging community residents, its focus is on impacting climate change and urban forestry; with an overall intent to engage the community in a conversation around climate action, which ultimately leads to positive action on both public and private lands. The program is designed to involve everyone from individual residents, to families, entire neighbourhoods, organizations and local governments in determining what climate action they would they would like to focus on. One of the main elements focuses on urban forestry, but previous groups have also included items such as urban food gardens, home improvements, car pooling and other local forms of active transportation. The program is designed to be applicable at the neighbourhood level to achieve the greatest impact. 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay | 25 SPECIAL INITIATIVES | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL PLAN — 2021 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The proposed 2021-2025 financial plan is summarized as follows: 2020 2021 | $Increase % Increase +13.6% + | $6.5M Operating Revenues | $47.5M | $54.0M Operating Expenses Transfers from Reserves (42.7)M (41.9)M 14.9M 16.9M Capital Expenditures Debt Principal Transfers to Reserves Total (12.1)M (21.1)M (0.1)M (0.1)M (7.5)M (7.8)M | $- | $- -0.8M +2.1M +9.0M - +0.3M -1.8% +13.8% +74.4% - Comment Capital Grants and COVID-19 restart grant Reduced COVID contingency Corresponds with increased capital spending See Capital Plan section +4.0% Increase for asset management targets Discussion of budgetary trends: Revenues: Revenues are budgeted to increase by 6.5M or 13.6%. This is due to a combination of factors: • Property taxes are budgeted to increase by 1.7M or 6.5%. Please see a breakdown of this increase below. • Capital Grants are budgeted to increase by | $6M primarily in anticipation of grant funding for the Uplands Sewer Separation capital project. This funding request is under review and there is significant uncertainty in possible success of the grant application. • Parks, Recreation and Culture revenues are forecasted to fall by approximately | $4.2M but are offset by | $1.6M in forecasted reduced spending. The net impact to the PRC department is offset by use of the COVID-19 restart grant in the amount of approximately | $2.6M. Expenses: Expenses are budgeted to decrease by | $763,000 or 1.8%. This is primarily due to: (1) a forecasted 1.2M decrease in PRC spending, (2) a decrease in the contingency budget of | $484,000, and (3) increase in other expenses by approximately | $1.3M. Capital Expenditures: Budgeted capital expenditures have increased by | $9.0M from | $12.1M to | $21.1M. The District is significantly expanding its capital program in response to a large portion of assets coming due for replacement. Reserve transfers: The District is rapidly increasing its utility and tax funded transfers to reserve to support forthcoming capital expenditures. Transfers from reserves correlate closely to reserve funded capital expenditures. Overall, the Financial Plan results in a 6.49% tax increase, or | $208 to the median residential property for 2021: Reason for tax increase: | $Increase to Median Residential property New Development Taxation Revenue Forced growth Infrastructure (transfer to reserve funding) New staffing to support sustainable service delivery Fire department apparatus bay lease Enhanced bylaw enforcement Total | $Amount | $(218,500) 920,200 500,000 377,000 90,000 52,000 | $1,720,700 Tax increase % -0.82% 3.47% 1.88% 1.42% 0.34% 0.20% 6.49% - | $26.41 111.22 60.43 45.56 10.88 6.28 | $207.96 26 | 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay | 26 DISTRICT OF OAK BAY | CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL PLAN SHORT-TERM RISKS TO THE 2021 - 2025 FINANCIAL PLAN The 2021 – 2025 financial plan has been prepared by integrating known economic conditions and existing Council direction. There are several risks that may impact the future financial results as discussed below: 1.COVID-19 Incremental COVID-19 expenses and reduced revenue impacts The District has integrated the expected financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic into the financial plan. In particular, the District is forecasting approximately | $4.2M in reduced Parks, Recreation and Culture revenues offset by approximately | $1.6M in reduced program expenditures for a net financial impact of | $2.6M in the 2021 budgetary year. In 2020, the District was the recipient of a | $3.6M COVID-19 restart grant. On November 23, 2020 Council resolved to use this grant to fund forecasted Parks, Recreation, and Culture revenue short falls in 2021 and 2022. Use of this grant has been integrated into the financial plan for 2021 and 2022. There is significant uncertainly around the timing and financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Should revenues not rebound quickly in 2022, Council will need to decide between reducing service, increasing taxes (or fees), or using additional reserves. Any of these strategies will materially impact the financial plan. In 2020, the District incurred approximately | $458,000 in incremental expenditures related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Approximately | $99,800 of this is recoverable and relates to the cost of operating the District's Emergency Operations Centre Department 2020 Incremental COVID-19 Expenses* Recoverable Net 2020 Incremental COVID-19 Expenses Corporate Administration Administrative Facilities Finance & IT | $56,312 8,170 18,639 | $(45,733) - (17,499) | $10,579 8,170 1,140 13,406 13,406 Policing 36,504 36,504 Fire and Emergency Services - 809 Building & Planning 6,482 7,593 Engineering Services 174,475 174,475 Public Works 1,618 1,618 Sewer Utility 2,832 2,832 Water Utility 103,210 137,812 Parks, Recreation & Culture Total | $358,416 | $458,170 *COVID-19 expenses include incremental expenses that in the judgment of staff have become necessary as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and were otherwise not incurred prior to the advent of the pandemic. - - (34,602) ( | $99,754) (809) (1,111) The District is expecting to continue to incur incremental COVID-19 related expenses in 2021. 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay | 26 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay | 27 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL PLAN | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY This risk of an exposure even has not been quantifiably integrated into the financial plan. For instance, should an entire platoon in the District’s fire or police department experience an exposure event, significant overtime would be incurred. Similarly, should an exposure event occur at one of the District’s recreational facilities, a major disruption to recreational revenues would be expected. Investment Revenues The District’s forecasted investment returns have been significantly reduced in the 2021-2025 financial plan when compared to the 2020 financial plan. The largest portion of the District’s investment portfolio is invested in Municipal Finance Authority funds including the Money Market Fund, the Short-Term Bond fund, and the Fossil Fuel Free fund. Bond yields have fallen significantly since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic as investors retreat from equities and seek out safer investments such as bonds. The District also has funds placed in interest bearing high interest savings accounts and term deposits. Interests rates offered by financial institutions have declined significantly as the Bank of Canada has eased monetary policy providing inexpensive access for financial institutions to cash resources. As a result, there is the risk that investment returns could further decline. In this case, forecasted reserve balances would fall if not offset with corresponding tax increases. 2. Reserve Balances Capital Grants The 2021-2025 financial plan includes the | $22.97M Uplands Sewer Separation project. This project is currently contingent on grant funding. The proposed funding sources are | $6.9M in reserve funding and | $16.0M in grant funding. As a party to the Core Area Liquid Waste Management Plan, the District has committed to separating combined sewers in the Uplands, both to meet the Province’s Municipal Wastewater Regulation but also to significantly reduce the amount of inflow of stormwater into the sanitary sewer system. This latter requirement is tied to the core area municipalities’ commitments to reduce inflow/infiltration in the sanitary sewer system to specific benchmarks by 2030. If the District’s grant application for this project is unsuccessful, the District’s ability to meet the 2030 inflow/infiltration targets will be significantly compromised. The District may need to fund the additional | $16M through other means in order to deliver on its Core Area Liquid Waste Management Plan commitments. The District has submitted a grant application for Tod House repairs. The District has identified the need for approximately | $300,000 - | $400,000 in needed deferred maintenance repairs plus an additional | $400,000 - | $500,000 in needed heritage conservation repairs. The District has dedicated reserves that could be used to fund the deferred maintenance repairs. Should the District be unsuccessful in its grant application, the District will need to utilize alternative funding or not proceed with heritage repairs. Asset Master Plans The 2021 financial plan allocated funding to complete the District’s Sanitary Sewer Master Plan, Storm Sewer Master Plan, Facilities Master Plan, and Parks Recreation and Culture Master Plan. These plans will further populate the District’s asset management/capital plan. This will likely put additional pressure on the District’s reserve balances. 3. Collective bargaining The District’s collective agreements with the International Association of Fire Fighters Local No. 1856 and the Oak Bay Police Association have expired in 2019. Forecasted collective agreement increases have been integrated into the District’s consolidated financial plan. Conditions used to forecast collective agreement increases change often. 28 | 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay DISTRICT OF OAK BAY | CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL PLAN CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL PLAN — YEAR OVER YEAR CHANGE Revenue 2020 Budget 2021 Budget Property Value Taxes New Construction Property Taxes Boulevard Frontage Taxes Grant In Lieu of Taxes 1% Utility Revenue Property Tax Penalties and Interest Grants (Operating) Grants (Capital) Developer Contributions | $26,530,000 - 215,300 53,200 220,300 127,400 530,500 866,700 | $28,250,700 218,500 221,300 53,300 221,700 167,800 3,050,900 6,923,700 Comment | $Change | $1,720,700 218,500 6,000 100 1,400 40,400 % Change 6.5% 0.0% 2.8% 0.2% 0.6% 31.7% 2,520,400 475.1% COVID-19 restart grant 6,057,000 689.9% Uplands sewer separation grant - 186,000 186,000 100.0% Bowker/Cadboro Bay intersection Investment Income 825,000 562,500 (262,500) Miscellaneous Revenue Municipal-Regional District Tax Facilities Department Revenue Finance Department Revenue Building and Planning Department Revenue Engineering Department Revenue Public Works Department Revenue Sewer Utility Fees Water Utility Fees Parks, Recreation and Culture Department Revenue 15,300 154,000 429,900 53,200 975,600 15,300 150,000 396,200 51,700 907,600 - (4,000) (33,700) (1,500) (68,000) 27,100 1,603,400 1,370,600 4,628,800 8,921,700 27,100 1,669,800 1,414,900 4,798,300 4,750,600 - 66,400 44,300 169,500 (4,171,100) -31.8% 85% decrease in money market return 0.0% -2.6% -7.8% OB Marina lease revenue reduction -2.8% -7.0% adj.

2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay DISTRICT OF OAK BAY | CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL PLAN REVENUE DISCUSSION TAXATION DISCUSSION Property value tax is the principal source of revenue for most local governments. It is a tax levied on the value of land and improvements (i.e. building and fixtures). Municipalities levy property value taxes based on the tax revenue needs set out in their annual budget (Financial Plan). Property value taxes are calculated by applying a set tax rate against the assessed value of a property. Municipal tax rates are annually set by Council, and the assessed values are set independently by BC Assessment. TAX STABILITY, PREDICTABILITY, COLLECTABILITY In most years, taxation revenue is predictable and stable. The District’s tax base is 96% residential. Therefore, disruptions in non-residential assessments would not disrupt tax revenues enough to significantly impact the predictability of tax revenues. In fact, a uniform and significant reduction in assessed values would be unlikely to disrupt tax revenues. The British Columbia legislated model of property taxation administration is one of the most efficient in the world. Tax revenue collection is highly likely, almost certain in most cases. The Local Government Act requires the District to commence tax sale proceeds in the cases where 3 years of taxes remain unpaid. Section 250 of the Community Charter writes, “Taxes accrued and to accrue on land and improvements... are a charge that, (a) is a special charge on the land and improvements, (b) has priority over any claim, lien, privilege or encumbrance of any person except the Crown…”. Therefore taxes are discharged, at a minimum, when the property changes ownership or during tax sale proceedings. Tax sale proceedings can result in the property being auctioned (although exceedingly rare), which ensures property taxes are highly collectible. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ASSESSMENTS AND TAXATION Municipalities use assessed values to apportion property taxes to individual taxpayers. For instance, if a taxpayer’s assessment represents 5% of the entire taxable assessment base, that taxpayer will pay 5% of the municipal property tax budget. A common misconception is that a significant increase in assessed value will necessarily result in a significant increase in property taxes. It is more important for a taxpayer to consider the assessed value in relation to the average assessment increase. It is possible for one’s assessment to decrease while taxes increase and vice versa. ASSESSMENT CHANGE PROPERTY TAX IMPACT Lower than average assessment increase/decrease Individual % tax increase < Total District % tax increase Average assessment increase/decrease Individual % tax increase % = Total District % tax increase Higher average assessment increase/decrease Individual % tax increase % > Total District % tax increase 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay | 33 REVENUE DISCUSSION | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY DISTRICT OF OAK BAY | REVENUE DISCUSSION The 2021 Completed Assessment Roll indicates a 4.86% average increase in residential assessed properties. The property tax increase for 2021 is 6.5%. Therefore, properties with an assessment change above 4.86% will incur a tax increase greater than 6.5%. Average tax increase: +6.5% +3% +4% +5% +6% +7% +8% +9% +10% +11% +12% ▲ +1% +2% +3% +4% +5% +6% +7% +8% +9% +10% +11% ▲ Average assessment change: 4.86% NEW DEVELOPMENT TAXATION (NDT) REVENUE NDT revenue is derived from new buildings or newly subdivided lots. In other words, NDT is taxation revenue from assessed values that did not exist in the prior year. Staff have estimated approximately | $200,000 derived from New Development Taxation Revenue in 2021. Final NDT numbers become available in March with the release of the revised assessment roll. NDT revenues are currently being set aside to increase the transfer to reserve for infrastructure replacement budget. FIVE YEAR PROPERTY TAXATION FORECASTS The draft 2021 – 2025 Financial Plan forecasts an average tax increase of 5.53% for the five year horizon and an average increase of 4.94% for 2022 through 2025: Tax increase Tax increase | $to median residential property 2021 6.49% | $208 2022 5.62% | $192 2023 4.95% | $179 2024 4.95% | $187 2025 4.95% | $197 Average 5.39% | $193 Forecasted tax increases are driven by the following factors: | $Increase by cost driver New Development Revenue 2021 ( | $218,500) 2022 ( | $50,000) 920,200 571,400 2023 ( | $50,000) 587,400 50,000 2024 ( | $50,000) 800,500 - 2025 | $(50,000) 883,500 - Forced Growth Contingency for operating impact of new capital services Infrastructure renewal reserve Fire Department apparatus bay lease New staffing Enhanced bylaw enforcement Debt retirement/new debt Total 34 | 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay 500,000 90,000 377,000 52,000 - 420,000 - 100,000 - 271,400 | $1,720,700 | $1,571,400 | $1,462,400 | $1,540,500 | $1,624,900 917,000 - 150,000 - (277,000) 725,000 - 150,000 - - 900,000 - 150,000 - - DISTRICT OF OAK BAY | REVENUE DISCUSSION % Increase by cost driver New Development Revenue Forced Growth Contingency for operating impact of new capital services Infrastructure renewal reserve Fire Department apparatus bay lease New staffing Enhanced Bylaw enforcement Debt retirement/new debt Total | $Impact to median residential property by cost driver New Development Revenue Forced Growth Contingency for operating impact of new capital services Infrastructure renewal reserve Fire Department apparatus bay lease New staffing Enhanced Bylaw enforcement Debt retirement/new debt Total 2024 2022 2021 2025 2023 -0.82% -0.18% -0.17% -0.16% -0.15% 2.66% 1.95% 3.47% 0.17% - - 1.26% 2.41% 1.88% - - 0.34% 0.30% 0.50% 1.42% 0.20% - - 0.82% - 4.89% 6.49% 2.53% - 2.90% - 0.47% - -0.88% 4.86% 2.01% - 3.16% - 0.53% - - 5.52% 4.86% 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 ( | $26.41) 111.22 - 60.43 10.88 45.56 6.28 ( | $6.00) 68.53 - 107.94 - 18.00 - ( | $5.99) 70.39 5.99 86.87 - 17.97 - ( | $5.98) 95.74 - 109.67 - 17.94 - ( | $5.97) 105.52 - 50.16 - 11.94 - - 32.41 | $207.96 | $188.47 | $175.23 | $184.24 | $194.06 (33.13) - - BOULEVARD FRONTAGE TAXES The District levies a boulevard frontage tax subject to the Boulevard Frontage Tax Bylaw, 1982.

Properties identified in this bylaw pay a tax based on taxable assessment. Taxes collected from this levy are remitted to the Oak Bay Business Improvement Association. The Oak Bay BIA exists to promote local member businesses and to contribute to the community at large. The funding arrangement with the BIA expires on December 31, 2024 if it is not renewed with another bylaw. GRANT IN LIEU OF TAXES Federal Payment in Lieu of Tax: Federally owned properties are generally exempt from taxes pursuant to section 125 of the Federal Constitution Act, 1867. Federal properties may, however, be subject to a payment in lieu of taxes pursuant to the Federal Payments in Lieu of Taxes Act. Two federally owned, tax exempt properties in the District pay a payment in lieu of taxes: (1) Turkey Head Breakwater, and (2) Trial Island Lighthouse. | $1,934* Turkey Head Breakwater | $4,516* Trial Island Lighthouse *Please note, the numbers detailed above are 2020 numbers. Grant in Lieu of Taxes, University of Victoria: The University of Victoria is exempt from taxes pursuant to section 54 of the University Act. The University is situated partially in the District of Oak Bay and partially in the District of Saanich. Annually the Ministry of Advanced Education, Skills and Training distributes a grant in lieu of taxes to local governments with universities. The funds are apportioned based on the proportional assessed value of university property within the municipality. The total grant fund budget has not changed in many years. Actual value of UVic property within Oak Bay is assessed at | $351M. The grant in lieu of taxes is equivalent to approximately 2.2% of the taxation revenue that would be due on | $351M of taxable assessment. The foregone taxes demonstrates the District’s significant investment in post-secondary education. 36 | 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay DISTRICT OF OAK BAY | REVENUE DISCUSSION 1% UTILITY REVENUE Pursuant to section 644 of the Local Government Act and the Hydro and Power Authority Annual Grants Order, utility companies must pay each municipality 1% of the revenues earned within that municipality in the preceding year. Since this revenue is based on prior year financials and amounts remitted to the District, the budget is very accurate. For 2021, 1% revenues are forecasted as follows: Utility Company Shaw Communications Telus Fortis BC Hydro Total Change -1,000/-3.4% -400/-2.1% +3,000/+8.5% -200/+0.0% +0.1% 2021 Budget | $28,300 18,500 38,400 136,500 | $221,700 2020 Budget | $29,300 18,900 35,400 136,700 | $220,300 2020 Actual | $29,290 18,914 35,427 136,740 | $220,371 MUNICIPAL REGIONAL DISTRICT TAX (MRDT) The Municipal and Regional District Tax (MRDT) is a tax of up to three percent on the purchase of accommodation imposed in specific geographic areas of the province (designated accommodation areas) on behalf of municipalities, regional districts or eligible entities. The District is a designated accommodation area pursuant to the Designated Accommodation Area Tax Regulation 93/2013 Funds raised by means of the MRDT must be used for a prescribe purpose including: tourism marketing and sport hosting marketing. As such, MRDT funds raised in the municipality of Oak Bay fund Oak Bay Tourism. USER FEES Section 194 of the Community Charter enables Council to impose a fee in respect of all or part of a municipal service. In general, user fees are charged when the benefit of a service accrues to identifiable individuals and taxes are levied when the benefit of a service accrues broadly to the public. However, Council has the authority to vary the mix and imposition of taxes and user fees as appropriate. Below are some of the user fees that the District levies. Sewer User Fees: The District levies a sewer user fee to recover 70% of the costs to maintain the municipal sanitary sewer conveyance system. The remaining 30% of such costs are recovered by property taxes. The sewer user fee also partially funds an annual transfer to reserve for capital asset replacement and rehabilitation. Sewer user fees are calculated by multiplying the sewer rate by 60% of water consumption for residential properties. Rates are applied to 100% of the water used by properties that are not residential, have mixed use, or have two water meters. Capital Regional District Sewer User Fee: The District levies a user fee to recover 100% of the operating costs related to providing regional sewer service including the Core Area Wastewater Treatment Plant. This levy has experienced steep increases for a number of years while the Capital Regional District phases in the cost of construction. In 2021, the treatment plant costs are expected to convert from capital to operating costs. It is expected that the increase in 2021 will be moderate when compared to historical increases. However, in 2021, the District is expecting a 22.5% increase in the requisition (property tax funded) cost from | $3.4M to | $4.2M. 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay | 37 REVENUE DISCUSSION | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY Water User Fee: The District levies a water consumption charge and a fixed user fee to recover 100% of the costs related to the provision of retail water. The majority of the costs relate to the purchase of bulk water from the Capital Regional District for distribution to District citizens. The fixed fee recovers 35%, while the consumption fee recovers 65%. For properties with two or less units, the fixed fee is | $0.62 per day or | $226.30 per year. Solid Waste User Fee: The District levies a solid waste fee pursuant to the District’s Refuse Collection and Disposal Bylaw. The solid waste fee funds a myriad of services described below. The District’s solid waste fee revenue exceeds the solid waste division direct costs but also funds solid waste service infrastructure replacement and general District overhead. Solid Waste Division Service 2021 Budget Proportion Service Description | $601,400 Solid Waste 38.2% Bi-weekly curbside pickup and unlimited drop off at depot Organics Garden Waste Program Beach Cleanup 444,200 214,100 6,200 28.2% Bi-weekly curbside pickup 13.6% Unlimited drop off at depot, compost sales 0.4% 2-4 clean up crew days per year or 1 sunken sailboat removal Garden Waste Pickup Week 126,700 8.1% One day per week per property per year curb- Recycling Depot Total 180,000 | $1,572,600 side garden waste 11.5% Unlimited drop off at depot 100.0% 38 | 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay DISTRICT OF OAK BAY | REVENUE DISCUSSION Grants (Operating) The District’s operating grant budget is composed of four main grants: (1) Small Community Grant, (2) Traffic Fine Revenue Sharing Grant, (3) Climate Action Revenue Incentive Program Grant (CARIP), and (4) project-related grants.

Accounting standards require that the grant be recorded as revenue in 2020. The District has transferred it to reserves to use to offset anticipated 2021 and 2022 Parks, Recreation, and Culture revenue shortfalls. The grant is placed in this chart for transparency. However, it will appear as a “transfer from reserve” in the financial plan bylaw. Small Community Grant: This grant is an unconditional grant paid by the Province to the District. The formula that determines the grant amount is complex. The grant is phased out as a community grows. +2,557,000 +1,700 + | $2,520,400 2,557,000 1,700 | $3,050,900 - | $530,500 Traffic Fine Revenue Sharing Grant: This grant amount is determined by the total Provincial traffic fine revenue collected in the year prior. Oak Bay’s share of the funds are determined by the District’s policing costs as a proportion of the entire Province’s policing costs. CARIP Grant: The CARIP grant is a conditional grant program that provides funding to local governments that have signed the B.C. Climate Action Charter, equal to 100 percent of the carbon taxes they pay directly to support local government operations. The program encourages investment in climate action. Project related grants: : Project grants contemplated in the 2021 budget year include: (1) | $55,000 from the Municipal Asset Management Program through the Federation of Canadian Municipalities to help fund a Pavement Condition Assessment, and (2) | $42,000 from the Provincial Urban Deer Operation Cost Share Program for half the cost of the District’s partnership with the Urban Wildlife Stewardship Society. Grants (Capital) Gas tax: The Administrative Agreement on the Federal Gas Tax Fund in British Columbia took effect on April 1, 2014. The tripartite Agreement between Canada-British Columbia-UBCM replaced the 2005-2014 Agreement and provides the administrative framework for the delivery of Federal Gas Tax funding to local governments and other recipients in British Columbia over a ten year period (2014-2024). The Gas Tax fund provides predictable, long-term and stable funding to local governments in British Columbia for investment in infrastructure and capacity building projects. The gas tax allocation table sets out funding through 2024. 2019 | $851,133.48 2020 | $816,756.82 2021 | $816,756.82 2022 | $853,872.73 2023 | $853,872.73 2024 | $890,979.58 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay | 39 REVENUE DISCUSSION | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY In 2014 when the new agreement was signed, the eligible project categories expanded significantly. This prompted many communities to change their gas tax revenue recognition practice. Previously, all gas tax revenues had been deferred and listed as a liability on the financial statements until used for eligible projects at which time the revenue was recognized. Since use of the funds is less restricted, the common accounting practice is to recognize the receipt of funds as revenue immediately. In fact, the District’s 2018 Audit Findings report recommended this accounting practice (see Special Meeting of Council agenda May 6, 2019). Beginning in 2020, the District will change its accounting practice to immediately recognize the receipt of gas tax funds as revenue. Gas tax funds are allocated to the District’s Infrastructure Renewal reserve through the course of this Financial Plan. The 2019 capital grants revenue category has been restated to include all gas tax payments even though the majority of such payments were recorded in the deferred liability account. The purpose of the restatement is to promote fiscal period comparability. INVESTMENT REVENUE Investment returns grew considerably from 2015 - 2019 due to two main factors: (1) increased investment balances, and (2) increased money market performance. Approximately 80% of the District’s portfolio had been invested in the Municipal Finance Authority’s Money Market Fund. 2015 Actual 2016 Actual 2017 Actual 2018 Actual 2019 Investment Revenues Investment Revenues Budget Cash and Investment Balance MFA money market return % | $442,099 | $174,000 | $418,239 | $152,000 | $483,431 | $130,000 | $883,881 | $140,000 | $996,143 | $301,500 | $35.7M | $41.0M | $46.5M | $54.1M | $60.1M 0.85% 0.79% 0.97% 1.65% 1.88% 2020 (preliminary) | $834,000 | $825,000 The investment return budget has been increased by | $523,500 to reflect the changing investment environment. The majority of our investment funds belong to reserve funds. Interest earned on these balances must be retained in the reserve funds. As a result staff, have increased the transfer to reserve budget by a corresponding amount: Investment Returns General Revenue Transfer to Reserve Total budgetary impact | $2020 Budget | $825,000 -450,000 -375,000 - 2021 Budget | $526,500 -449,000 -113,500 - Change - | $262,500 +(1,000) +(261,500) - Linking investment returns to reserve contributions is crucial for a number of reasons: 1. There is a legislated requirement to ensure investment returns earned by reserve funds remain within the reserve fund. 2. General revenue linked investment returns can significantly increase tax rate volatility. For instance, should 3. investment returns fall, tax revenues will have to rise to offset the loss. Investment returns from reserve funds are part of the District’s annual, permanent, ongoing funding for infrastructure replacement. 40 | 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay DISTRICT OF OAK BAY | REVENUE DISCUSSION OPERATING DEPARTMENT SUMMARIES 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay 41 FINANCIAL LEGISLATION, POLICY AND BEST PRACTICES | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY CORPORATE ADMINISTRATION Administration consists of the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO), the Director of Corporate Services, the Deputy Director of Corporate Services, the Director of Strategic Planning, the Manager of Human Resources, a Communications Specialist, the Executive Assistant to the CAO and Mayor, and an administrative support staff person.

These funding targets are derived by dividing the replacement cost of an asset class by its average useful life. If such funding targets are implemented as soon as capital is constructed, then in theory, the District should have enough funding in its reserves to fund replacement at the end of an asset’s useful life. However, the District has not integrated sustainable funding levels during the lifespan of most of its assets. Therefore, there the District has likely accumulated a cumulative infrastructure funding deficit as is the case with the vast majority of all Canadian municipalities. The District intends on quantifying and reporting its cumulative infrastructure funding deficit in an infrastructure replacement plan. This plan is expected by fall of 2022 at the latest and fall of 2021 at the earliest. 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay | 75 ASSET MANAGEMENT | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY ASSET REPLACEMENT FUNDING PROGRESS - FIVE YEAR FORECAST The draft 2021-2025 financial plan continues to increase asset replacement funding. Sustainable infrastructure replacement funding is estimated to be | $9.492M in 2021 dollars. The District has made significant progress in closing the infrastructure funding gap since 2017. In 2017, funding levels were estimated be at approximately 43% of sustainable levels. The draft financial plan closes this estimated funding gap completely by 2024.

The replacement cost of the assets represented in this estimate may be subject to volatile cost escalation as construction costs rise. Furthermore, the District is planning to conduct the following asset master plans that may impact estimates: (1) Facilities Master Plan, (2) Sanitary Sewer Master Plan, and (3) Stormwater Master Plan. 76 | 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay DISTRICT OF OAK BAY | ASSET MANAGEMENT HOW WELL ARE WE REPLACING? The District has increased capital replacement output significant over the past five years. Capital progress output may be measured in the context of the total size and age of the District’s existing asset inventory. The District will be providing asset replacement output information in its asset management strategy. This information will be integrated into future financial plans. Some capital replacement output measures may include: • Physical measurement of assets replaced such as linear or square meters, number of units replaced, • Proportion of system replaced, • Weighted average ages of asset class, • Proportion of asset class beyond recommended useful life, and • Condition assessment information by asset class. This information combined with the District’s forthcoming infrastructure replacement plan will be used to provide options for Council to consider the pace at which assets can replaced. 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay | 77 ASSET MANAGEMENT | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY ASSET CLASS INVENTORY Asset Type Roads Buildings Drainage Vehicles & Equip. (Fire) Vehicles & Equip.(Police) Vehicles & Equip. (General) Vehicles & Equip. (Rec) IT Equip. & Furniture Sewer Infrastructure Water Infrastructure Natural Assets Information and Assumptions Staff use pavement unit rates to multiply by pavement quantities to estimate replacement costs. This estimate should be revised once a pavement condition assessment is complete. Staff used recent insurance appraisals to value the replacement cost of our current inventory stock. Staff also considered the Building Asset Management report prepared by Moore Wilson Architects Inc.

Individual reserve fund projections are outlined on the following pages. 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay | 81 CAPITAL PLAN | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY Climate Action Reserve The District is a signatory of the BC Climate Action Charter. Under the Charter, the District commits to becoming carbon neutral in corporate operations, measuring and reporting progress and creating more energy efficient communities. As a signatory, the District is eligible for to receive 100% of the carbon taxes paid during the year as a rebate. Proceeds from this rebate have been transferred to the District’s Climate Action Reserve since 2012. Major Crimes Reserve Annually the Police Board budgets for a transfer to the Major Crime Reserve. These funds are set aside pursuant to the annual budget request from the Police Board. Fire Machinery and Equipment Reserve Fund The Fire Machinery and Equipment reserve fund was originally establish pursuant to Bylaw No. 3773, “Fire Machinery and Equipment Depreciation Reserve Fund Bylaw, 1993”. This Bylaw was recently repealed and replaced by Bylaw No. 4747, the “Reserve Funds Bylaw, 2020”. Money in this fund and interest earned on it shall only be used for extending the useful life, upgrading or replacement of fire machinery and equipment. Two of the Fire Department’s major pieces of apparatus are due for replacement between 2020-2022: (1) Engine with light rescue, and (2) 75-ft Ladder Truck. These vehicles are expected to cost over | $3.2M. The Fire Machinery and Equipment reserve balance was approximately | $1.5M at the beginning of 2020. As a result of these purchases, the reserve is expected to be negative. Staff intend on borrowing from other reserves to fund the purchases. Staff analyzed the annual fire equipment reserve funding levels and determined that this funding needs to be doubled approximately from | $190k to | $370k annually. This will ensure that fire apparatus is funded sustainable for the entire fleet. Staff will appropriate a portion of the annual infrastructure renewal reserve funding to increase the fire equipment reserve funding. The Reserve fund is forecasted to remain negative for many years until a healthy and sustainable reserve fund balance can be restored. Heritage Reserve Fund The principal of the Heritage Reserve Fund represents the net profit from the Municipality’s development of the Wessex Close subdivision in 1980-81. Over and above the statutory requirement that monies in the fund be expended only for the purpose of capital projects, the Bylaw establishing the Heritage Reserve Fund provides further that with the exception of interest, no monies may be appropriated from the Fund “save those required for the purpose of land development projects and other capital investments designed to augment the net present value of the principal.” 82 | 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay DISTRICT OF OAK BAY | CAPITAL PLAN Machinery and Equipment The Machinery and Equipment reserve fund was originally establish pursuant to Bylaw No. 2074, “Reserve for Machinery and Equipment Bylaw” and Bylaw No. 3773, the “Machinery and equipment Depreciation Reserve”. These Bylaws were recently repealed and replaced by Bylaw No. 4747, the “Reserve Funds Bylaw, 2020”. Money in this fund and interest earned on it shall only be used for extending the useful life, upgrading or replacement of machinery and equipment. Much of the District’s fleet is due for replacement in and will be replaced in the next 5 years. However, reserve funding levels are believed to be sustainable for the long term. For further information on the asset replacement funding, please see the State of Asset Replacement Funding section of this Financial Plan. Parks Acquisition Reserve Fund Under the Section 510 of the Local Government Act, an owner of land being subdivided into three or more lots must either provide park land or pay cash in lieu. Section 188 of the Community Charter requires that such payments are credited to a statutory reserve fund. This reserve fund may only be used for the purpose of acquiring new park lands. Capital Works Reserve Fund This reserve fund was originally established via Bylaw no. 3775, the “Capital Works and Equipment Reserve Fund Bylaw”. This Bylaw has since been repealed and replaced with Bylaw No. 4747, the “Reserve Fund Bylaw, 2020”. The primary purpose of the Capital Works Reserve Fund is to provide a means of financing major repairs or replacement of physical assets while moderating tax increases. Annual contributions for water main replacement and sewer rehabilitation are directed to this reserve, among other transfers. Note that this fund is consolidated into one balance in the District’s annual public sector accounting standard financial statements. For budgeting purposes, the District has separated the capital works reserve into three funds: general, sewer and water. The District is entering an era of significant infrastructure replacement. As a result, the District’s Capital Works reserve is forecasted to decrease significantly. Some significant capital works reserve funded projects include: Projects 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 Municipal Hall Renovation Parks and Recreation Projects Oak Bay Recreation Centre Roof Sewer Rehabilitation Watermain Replacement North Oak Bay Pump Station | $1.2M 0.7M 0.6M 1.0M 0.3M 1.5M 0.7M 2.3M 0.2M 0.5M 0.6M 0.6M 0.6M 0.9M 0.6M 0.9M 0.6M 0.8M 6.0M 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay | 83 CAPITAL PLAN | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY Alternative Transportation Infrastructure Reserve Fund Section 525 of the Local Government Act permits a local government to collect a payment in lieu of off-street parking as a condition of a building permit. These payments must be placed in a reserve. Such payments were deposited to the District's Village Parking Reserve which was established under Bylaw No. 3631, the “Parking Reserves Fund Establishment Bylaw, 1989”. Subsequent to the establishment of the District's Village Parking Reserve, legislation was enacted to allow Council to use the reserve for transportation infrastructure that supports walking, bicycling, and public transit, in addition to the provision of new off-street parking. The District then created its Alternative Transportation Infrastructure reserve pursuant to Bylaw No. 4422, the “Alternative Transportation Infrastructure Reserve Fund Establishment Bylaw, 2008”. These reserves were subsequently combined via Bylaw No. 4747, the “Reserve Funds Bylaw, 2020”. Combining the Village Parking and Alterative Transportation Infrastructure reserves enabled Council to use the combined balances of nearly | $1M for either purpose. Infrastructure Renewal Reserve This reserve was established by administrative practice and not by Bylaw. The District established this reserve through budget deliberations in 2017. Annually, the District receives approximately | $800k in gas tax funds via the Union of BC Municipalities. These funds are deposited into the infrastructure renewal reserve. Annual gas tax proceeds are deposited to the credit of this reserve. In 2021, the significant capital expenditures funded by this reserve include: (1) Pavement Management Plan ( | $1.3M), (2) Transportation Safety Improvements ( | $0.5M), and (3) Storm Sewer Rehabilitation ( | $0.6M). Legacy Trust The Legacy Trust consists of various bequests to the Municipality for specific purposes — i.e. improvements to the Seniors’ Activity portion of the Monterey Centre. The Public Art Fund is also included here. Tod House Trust The Tod House Trust was established to fund repairs to the historic residence at 2564 Heron Street, which used to be jointly owned by the Municipality and the Province. In 2008 the Province gave its share to Oak Bay, but only “for so long as the land is used for the specific purpose of managing the Tod House Heritage Site”. Correspondence with the Province suggests that if the property use were to change, the District will pay to the Province 50% of the market value of the property at the time that its use changed. The Trust is built up from the net rental revenue. Upland Sewer Separation Gas Tax Reserve Fund The District has accumulated and set aside | $6.1M in gas tax funds specifically for the Uplands Sewer Separation Project. These funds are classified as a liability in the District’s financial statements due to the public nature of the commitment to this specific project. Therefore, the total dollar value of this reserve fund can be found in Note 3 of the financial statements. Most other reserves are found in Note 7 of the financial statements. Gas tax revenues received subsequent to 2018 have been transferred and will continue to be transferred to the infrastructure renewal reserve. This deferred revenue reserve balance is capped at the estimated cost of the Humber Catchment construction project. 84 | 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay DISTRICT OF OAK BAY | CAPITAL PLAN DEBT MANAGEMENT FIVE YEAR FORECAST The District may choose to incur debt to finance capital expenditures. The Community Charter and Municipal Liabilities Regulation establishes debt limits for the District. The maximum amount of debt a municipality may undertake is subject to the liability servicing limit. A municipality may not incur debt if the total annual debt servicing cost is greater than 25 percent of annual controllable sustainable revenues. Municipal long term borrowing in British Columbia must occur through the Municipal Finance Authority (MFA) and the financing must be undertaken by the municipality’s regional district. This legislated relationship creates a joint and several liability between the regional district members. The MFA has the legislated authority to levy taxation on all taxable properties within British Columbia. These factors create a strong institutional and governance framework that helps the MFA retain a triple-A credit rating and exceptionally low borrowing costs on behalf of BC municipalities. When municipalities borrow, principal payments are invested by the MFA. Investment earnings are returned to the borrowing municipality via reduced principal payments. For instance, in 2004, the District borrowed | $4.7M to upgrade the Oak Bay Rec Centre. The debt from this will be paid off in 2023. Over the 20 years, the District’s debt principal will have been reduced by approximately | $1.86M. These debt principal reductions are referred to as ‘actuarial adjustments’. In the 2020 – 2024 Financial Plan, the District’s annual controllable sustainable revenues will exceed | $46M, making its annual liability servicing limit approximately | $11.5M. Annual debt servicing costs are not expected to exceed | $300,000 which amounts to approximately 2.6% of the District’s liability servicing limit. Debt payments including interest and principal for the next five years are forecasts as follows: Year Beginning Balance New Debt* End Balance | $Principal | $Interest | $Total Payments | $Actuarial % Liability Servicing Limit** 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 | $1,030,323 703,495 360,328 - - 5,000,000 | $703,495 360,328 - - 5,000,000 142,594 142,594 142,594 - 128,149 134,378 134,378 134,378 - 100,000 276,972 276,972 276,972 - 228,149 184,234 200,573 217,734 - - 2.3% 2.3% 2.2% 0.0% 1.8% *New debt for Carnarvon Park Building with 30-year amortization, presumed debt interest rate of 2.0% **Assumes a 2.5% annual increase to controllable sustainable revenues The District is expecting to have an infrastructure replacement report published by fall 2021 through fall of 2022. This report may recommend incurring debt in the short term to fund capital asset replacement. This may be necessary to avoid exhausting reserves or deferring recommended capital replacement. 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay | 85 CAPITAL PLAN | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY CAPITAL BUDGET SUMMARY BY DEPARTMENT Capital Expenditures 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 Total Corporate Administration Finance and IT Police Department Fire Protection Engineering Services Public Works Parks, Recreation and Culture Water Utility Sewer Utility | $145,000 285,600 114,500 4,196,800 10,724,400 1,858,300 1,604,600 725,200 1,456,200 | $310,000 210,000 155,000 133,200 5,823,400 605,000 1,970,000 927,800 2,940,800 - 266,200 125,000 50,000 12,452,000 312,000 1,420,700 667,500 7,059,400 - 292,000 155,000 166,600 11,600,000 210,000 879,400 680,500 1,119,000 - 424,200 125,000 88,300 4,134,500 405,000 5,684,900 702,300 1,137,500 | $455,000 1,478,000 674,500 4,634,900 44,734,300 3,390,300 11,559,600 3,703,300 13,712,900 Total | $21,110,600 | $13,075,200 | $22,352,800 | $15,102,500 | $12,701,700 | $84,342,800 Funding Sources: Reserves Developer Contributions Fees and Charges Grants Borrowing Total 16,303,500 186,000 132,600 4,488,500 - 11,187,200 - 138,000 1,750,000 - 16,935,050 - 140,800 5,276,950 - 9,681,950 - 143,600 5,276,950 - 7,556,700 - 145,000 - 5,000,000 61,664,400 186,000 700,000 16,792,400 5,000,000 | $21,110,600 | $13,075,200 | $22,352,800 | $15,102,600 | $12,701,700 | $84,342,800 CAPITAL BUDGET SUMMARY BY ASSET CLASS Capital Expenditures 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 Total Building Vehicle Equipment Road Drainage Land Impr.

This project would upgrade the website to refresh the look and feel, improve navigation, optimize search capabilities and provide for content management functionality. This project will support communications, service excellence and address a recommendation to invest in the website from the Mayor’s Task Force on Public Engagement. Phase 2 of this project proposes to develop an internal intranet for staff use. Project scoping of phase 2 has not been fully developed. Council Chambers Audio Equipment Upgrade (price change, scope increase) The equipment currently in use in the Council Chambers has surpassed the end of life schedule and requires upgrading. The current equipment is fragile and subject to failure. In 2020, staff proposed to purchase a central processing unit along with new wireless microphones to provide greater flexibility for a variety of meeting setups in the Council Chambers. New equipment will reduce or eliminate equipment malfunctions, require less staff time for meeting setups, and support the new operational requirements of providing amplified sound for all Council, Committee and Commission meetings held inside the Council Chambers. This equipment will improve audio provisions for in-person attendees, as well as for those viewing the proceedings via livestream or archived video. The scope of this project has increased as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has highlighted the need to support meetings that combine remote and in-person attendance. Staff aim to be able to provide a full suite of remote participation options to the public while supporting limited in person staff and Council attendance. As a result, more hardware such as digital media presentation hardware and a new camera as well as additional wiring is required. 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay | 87 CAPITAL PLAN | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY Electronic Document Management System (new) An EDRMS will efficiently and systematically manage the District's electronic and paper documents throughout the life-cycle of the document (from creation to destruction). Records will be shared with all individuals who need access. It also supports the automatic enforcement of consistent policies and styles across the District and ensures Oak Bay is in compliance with Provincial and Federal legislation. As the EDRMS project progresses and electronic records are more readily accessible, it will allow the District to reduce the physical space required to store paper documents and physical records, and will keep vital records safe from physical hazards like fire, floods or other damage. Municipal Hall Shelving (new) The physical records phase of the Records Management project commenced in 2020 and continues into 2021. The Municipal Hall Renovation project provides an excellent opportunity to install appropriate record and box storage shelving that will reduce the amount of space required for storage overall and increase capacity by 40- 50% reducing costs for offsite storage (or increasing space for other uses). 88 | 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay DISTRICT OF OAK BAY | CAPITAL PLAN FINANCIAL SERVICES AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY Capital Purchase/Project IT Project Management Division Payroll Software Phase I Payroll Software Phase II Payroll Software Phase III Development Tracker Other IT Project Management Division Projects Asset Type 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 Equipment Equipment Equipment Equipment Equipment | $14,000 34,000 53,200 68,000 - - - - - - - - - - - 170,000 - - 170,000 - - 170,000 - - 170,000 Network and Other IT Hardware PC Hardware Replacement IT Master Plan Items Equipment Equipment Equipment 46,400 70,000 25,000 15,000 65,600 30,600 17,000 105,000 101,200 153,000 <<Master Plan recommendations under review>> Total Finance Capital | $285,600 | $210,000 | $266,200 | $292,000 | $424,200 Carry-over Price Change Year Change New Item IT Project Management Division This division was created in late 2020. The majority of costs incurred in this division are for staffing and the remainder are for software acquisition and consulting. The leadership team is responsible for prioritizing the activities in this division as it is intended to support corporate operations and Council strategic Priorities. The payroll project and the development tracker have been prioritized for 2021. Projects 2022+ have not been selected, although there are a number of projects that have been shortlisted. The scope of the payroll software project phase I includes the transition of inside staff, fire, and police over to the centralized payroll software. Payroll payment processing is currently outsourced. The process is currently inefficient as data has to be exported to external payment providers, then re-imported into the District’s general ledger system. The new software has seamless integration with the District’s general ledger system and main financial institution. The product also provides many self-serve options to our employees and eliminates the need for printed paystubs. The scope of payroll software phase II includes the transition to an integrated timesheeting and entitlement balancing system. This will eliminate many redundant processes and improves internal controls over entitlement balancing. The scope of payroll software phase III includes the transition of the remaining payrolls to the centralized payroll software including auxiliary staff. The development tracker is a mobile application integrated with our land use system. This application provides 24/7 online access to land-use applications and related information. As this would be a new capital service, approval of this project would create a perpetual tax increase/ to support ongoing operating costs and eventual software replacement. 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay | 89 CAPITAL PLAN | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY Network Switch and other IT Hardware This capital project includes the following multi-year components: Network Switch Replacement Firewall Phone system upgrade Uninterruptible Power Supply Servers Backups Wireless Access Points Oak Bay Recreation Centre Camera System Contingency Total 2021 - - - - 8,900 - 5,500 30,000 2022 - 8,000 15,000 - - - - - 2023 - - - 1,700 61,900 - - - 2024 - - 15,000 - - - - - 2,000 2,000 | $46,400 | $25,000 | $65,600 | $17,000 2,000 2,000 2025 | $64,000 4,000 1,200 - - - - 30,000 2,000 | $101,200 PC Hardware Replacement The Information Technology division deploys and maintains over 250 pieces of hardware for over 300 users. This inventory is valued at nearly | $200,000 and does not include printers or network hardware. Staff have established annual reserve contributions so that the financial impact of hardware replacement is not volatile. In 2020, the PC Hardware Replacement program was accelerated, funded primarily by savings in the Network Hardware Replacement Capital program. The acceleration was necessary to support a shift to remote working as well as security patching, and a unified support model. IT Master Plan As part of the 2019-2022 Council Priorities, an Information Technology Master Plan has been developed. Information Technology is a corporate division whose primary function is to support internal department busines processes. The departments deliver external services to the community as directed by Council. The IT Master Plan provides in-depth information related to IT support of District operations. The plan also contains many recommendations that need to be considered by the leadership team. The leadership team is charged with weighing risk vs cost implications of recommending resources that support Council directed community services. 90 | 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay DISTRICT OF OAK BAY | CAPITAL PLAN POLICE SERVICES Capital Purchase/Project Police Vehicle Replacement Police Computer Equipment Replacement Asset Type Vehicle Equipment 2021 | $74,500 30,000 2022 | $70,000 70,000 2023 | $70,000 40,000 2024 | $70,000 70,000 2025 | $70,000 40,000 Traffic Enforcement Equipment - 5,000 5,000 5,000 5,000 Equipment Police Building Repairs Building 10,000 10,000 10,000 10,000 10,000 Total Oak Bay Police Capital | $114,500 | $155,000 | $125,000 | $155,000 | $125,000 Carry-over Price Change Year Change New Item Police Vehicle Replacement The Police Department maintains a small fleet of patrol vehicles and administrative vehicles.

The Department is reviewing options for deploying reduced emission vehicles. Total cost of the vehicles includes manufacturing and transportation as well as outfitting with equipment and branding. Police Computer Equipment Replacement Information Technology for the District’s police force is managed by the Saanich Police Department (SPD). SPD advises on an IT equipment replacement plan. Computer equipment expenditures are forecasted to be approximately | $250,000 over the next five years. Traffic Enforcement Equipment The Police Department maintains a small annual budget to replace traffic enforcement equipment to meet the priority of Traffic Safety.

The primary standards that govern the design, maintenance, performance and replacement lifecycles for motorized fire apparatus are; ULC S515, NFPA 1901 and Canadian Fire Underwriters Survey (FUS). Under these standards, Engines and Quints are permitted to operate in a primary capacity for 15-years and a reserve capacity for 5-years. Thus a 20-year maximum service lifecycle is the industry standard. The 1990 Engine reached the end of its service lifecycle in February of 2010. This Engine is now 10-years past due for replacement. Consequently, no credit is being given towards the District’s current FUS Grading. When current procurement and build times within the fire apparatus industry are considered; it is projected that this Engine will not be physically replaced until late 2021. Delaying this purchase will negatively impact the Districts current FUS Grading. This will likely increase the financial cost of fire insurance for residents, businesses and institutions. 92 | 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay DISTRICT OF OAK BAY | CAPITAL PLAN Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) (carry-over) PPE is the protective ensemble that firefighters wear while responding to fires, vehicle accidents, fire alarms and other calls. Arguably, PPE sees the most wear and tear of any safety equipment in use with Oak Bay firefighters. This capital project will allow the District to ensure the replacement of this critical safety equipment while managing safety and risk over the long term. Within the global firefighting industry, the occurrence of cancer within firefighters has become a significant occupational hazard. If the District is able to prevent a single presumptive firefighter cancer claim the savings are substantial. Such claims can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and can significantly impact WorkSafe premiums for years. Such an illness would have a severe impact on an individual, their family and the organization. PPE manufacturers are engineering new features into their garments that protect against carcinogens. By investing in these new protective features the District will be making significant strides towards managing this threat. The life-cycle costs have been integrated into the District’s equipment replacement plan and will be funded by annual reserve contributions. Fire Hall Interior Painting (carry-over) This project would result in painting of the apparatus bays, offices and corridors. The interior apparatus bays were last painted in 2004 and the offices and corridors have had a patchwork of painting and repairs occur since that time. Regular painting of areas projects a positive and professional image to our residents as we have several public tours and educational sessions held in the station throughout the year. Emergency Generator (carry-over) The District currently owns two generators that are at end of life (44 years and 35 years respectively). In 2017, Emery Electric conducted a survey of electrical power requirements for the Police and Fire Departments and found that the emergency generator units are at times over capacity and at risk of failure. A failure of either generator during a power outage would have significant impact on the operations of the Fire and Police Departments. The new generator would supply power for both departments for an increased duration and higher degree of reliability.1 Hall Door Enlargement (carry-over) This capital budget funds the installation of a leased portable apparatus bay and the renovation of a 1963 era apparatus bay door. The initial capital funding will be used to prepare for and install the portable apparatus bay and improve an apparatus bay door. After the initial install and renovation, monthly lease payments will require ongoing funding. Leasing a portable apparatus storage bay will create space for a modern 100+ Foot Quint that is designed to meet the needs of the community. Renovating a 1963 era apparatus bay door creates a space for a modern Engine that is designed to meet the needs of the community. 1 Budget Estimates Committee, April 17, 2019 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay | 93 CAPITAL PLAN | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY Conceptual Drawing Courtesy of Extreme Portable Buildings The dynamics of the legacy 1938/1962 OBFD fire station has created apparatus design issues for the past 30-years. Both the 1990 Engine and the 2002 Quint were designed to fit into the station rather than be optimized to serve the community. The fire station is well beyond its useful lifecycle however, replacement will take time. The addition of the portable apparatus bay and renovation of the door will buy the District time to plan for replacement. The lease options of the portable apparatus bay provides financial flexibility. Leasing also allows the District to allocate capital towards the renewal of the fire fleet which will ensure excellent service delivery. Leasing allows the District to consider the long term plan for the fire station. The portable apparatus storage carries a number of lease buy out options. Emergency Program Vehicle Replacement (carry-over) The current Municipal Emergency Response Vehicle (MERV) is 30 years old and has far exceeded its life cycle. The current vehicle is not conducive to towing three Emergency Program trailers and lacks standard safety enhancements. The purchase of a short box 4 wheel drive pickup truck will allow the Emergency Program Volunteers the ability to safely and effectively respond to calls for service regardless of road conditions and will allow the option of responding in a simple pickup truck or truck and trailer combination as required. Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) Equipment and Training (Grant funded, carry-over) The Union of BC Municipalities has established a grant program called the Community Emergency Preparedness Fund. One of the grant steams available supports Emergency Operations Centres & Training. Staff are preparing a grant application but have yet to identify what specific training and equipment would be part of the application. Emergency Support Services Equipment (Grant Funded, carry-over) The Union of BC Municipalities has established a grant program called the Community Emergency Preparedness Fund. One of the grant steams available supports Emergency Support Services. Staff are preparing a grant application but have not yet determined the specific grant contents. C-Can Based Training Prop This is a capital project to install a new C-Can Based Training Prop (Prop) near the fire station. This plan also includes the re-design and integration of the 1967 era Training Tower (Tower). This new Prop would better simulate firefighting operations in the single-family, multi-family and commercial occupancies found in Oak Bay. Unfortunately, the Tower is unrealistic and provides limited training value. This dynamic is further complicated by the fact that access to realistic training locations within the District is becoming more restrictive. This location supports on-duty training which is important given current OBFD staffing models. In addition to being unrealistic, the Tower is starting to show its age. It was built in 1967 and has never seen any significant upgrades. Repairs for corrosion and structural concerns were completed in 1987 and 2007. Integration of the Tower into a new Prop would bring this piece of Oak Bay firefighting history back to life. 94 | 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay DISTRICT OF OAK BAY | CAPITAL PLAN Under WorkSafe BC and the OFC Playbook; the District has a moral and legal obligation to train its firefighters to NFPA standards. Furthermore, a commitment to training has always been part of the OBFD’s culture. Creating this new training space, with a combination of legacy and new materials supports this culture. It will ensure that Oak Bay firefighters secure a safe, realistic and adaptable training location for the long-term. Ladder Truck with Heavy Rescue Capabilities This capital budget would fund the replacement of the 2002 68 foot Quint with a new modern NFPA and ULC compliant 100+Foot Quint in 2020. The primary standards that govern the design, maintenance/ performance and replacement lifecycles for Engines are ULC S515, NFPA 1901 and Canadian Fire Underwriters Survey. Under these standards, Quints are permitted to operate in a primary capacity for 15-years and a reserve capacity for an additional 5-years. Maximum service lifecycle is 20-years. Provided that prescribed preventative maintenance and performance testing is successfully performed/documented throughout the life of the apparatus. The 2002 Quint will reach end of its service lifecycle in July of 2022. This 2002 Quint is the only Aerial Device serving Oak Bay. Due to the age of the 1990 Engine the Quint is also the only backup Engine serving Oak Bay. When current procurement and build times within the fire apparatus market are considered, it is likely that this Quint will not physically be replaced until early to mid 2022. Delaying this purchase beyond the 2021 budget year could negatively impact the current Fire Insurance Grading. This is likely to increase the financial cost of fire insurance for residents, businesses and institutions within the District. The OBFD fleet has not been expanded since 1962. Due to its small size, it simply lacks the capacity to compensate for an Engine or Quint that is reaching the end of its service lifecycle. Larger Fire Departments have additional capacity within their fleets to negate this type of compression. The lean nature of the Oak Bay Fire Department makes it critical that FUS replacement schedules are judiciously maintained. Compliance with these standards will manage fire insurance costs and protect the community from undue risk and liability associated with operating expired fire equipment. This purchase would result in the current 68-foot aerial ladder truck being replaced with a 100-foot ladder truck. The current 2002 Quint had to be built with a 75-foot Aerial Device in order to accommodate fire station limitations. When the 2002 Quint arrived, it did not fit length-wise into the apparatus bay. Unfortunately the solution was to physically cut-down the Aerial Device to make it fit. The result was a reduced Aerial Device with total length of 68-feet. The net change from 85-feet to 68-feet represented a 20% reduction in the overall reach. The current condition of the fire fleet is such that investment in a new Engine and a new 100+Foot Quint that meet community needs is critical. In order to accommodate the 100+Foot Quint, new apparatus storage is required. The new apparatus storage adds approximately 17.5% in life-cycle costs but the quint will have an additional 47% servicing potential. The 100ft ladder will also assist the District in maintaining strong relationships with the other core-three municipalities: Victoria, Saanich, and Esquimalt. 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay | 95 CAPITAL PLAN | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY Photo Courtesy of Spartan Fire Apparatus Example of Ladder Truck with Heavy Rescue Capailities Thermal Imaging Protective Equipment Thermal Imaging Cameras (TICs) are a significant expenditure and staff have integrated the equipment into the reserve-funded replacement program. TIC’s provide firefighters the gift of sight in dark and smoky conditions. They are arguably the single most important advancement in the global firefighting industry in the past 20-years. TIC’s expedite search and rescue as well as fire attack when seconds count. This Capital Project will allow the OBFD to ensure the replacement of this critical safety equipment and manage health and safety over the long term. Over the past 20 years, the use of light weight synthetic composites in building construction materials and furnishings has created a fire environment that is extremely challenging. Fires in 2020 do not ‘burn hotter’ than they did in the past. Modern fires reach peak temperatures much more rapidly and quickly generate extremely dark toxic smoke conditions while they expedite structural collapse. TIC’s allow firefighters to work efficiently in these extremely dark toxic smoke conditions. TIC technology is constantly advancing and replacement should occur every five-years. By reinvesting in state of the art TIC’s the District will be making significant strides towards meeting this evolving threat and optimizing firefighter effectiveness. Technical Rescue Protective Equipment The two primary standards that govern the use, care and replacement of Technical Rescue Equipment (TRE) are NFPA 1983 and WorkSafe BC Part 32. These standards require that all ‘soft-goods’ be replaced after five-years of active service. They also require replacement if TRE is physically damaged or contaminated with chemical and biological substances. Soft-goods comprises all harnesses, ropes, webbing and anchor straps. Hardware represents carabiners, pulleys, belay devices, tripods, stretchers and all the supporting safety equipment. TRE replacement has been integrated into the fire equipment replacement plan and funded by annual reserve contributions. Electric Pickup Truck This Capital budget will fund the replacement of the 2008 Toyota Camry Sedan (Camry) in 2022 with a new Hybrid or true Electric 4x4 pickup truck. The change from a Camry to a pickup is intended to provide the fire Department with an appropriate tool for the job. The Camry currently serves as a logistics and on-call duty officer vehicle. The Camry is a medium sized 4-door sedan style passenger car and it is not well suited for use in the fire service. The Camry does not have an NFPA 1901 compliant lights and sirens safety package. A new pickup would be NFPA 1901 compliant, have added safety features and be much more useful. In addition to the fact that the Camry is not suited for the role that it currently fills, it is starting to show its age. 96 | 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay DISTRICT OF OAK BAY | CAPITAL PLAN The vehicle is a hybrid but, it is first generation technology and significant repairs to the battery system are looming. By the time of replacement, the Camry will be 15 years old and it will have an estimated 150,000 to 160,000 kilometers. The lack of an NFPA 1901 compliant lights and sirens package restricts it to non-emergency use. A new Pick-Up will provide a vehicle that is much safer, more effective, able to function post-disaster and contribute towards the Districts environmental stewardship. OBFD staff are currently researching replacement options and anticipate that a true Electric Pick-Up will be available by 2022. Gas Detective Protective Equipment Gas Detectors are one of the most effective tools for protecting first responders from unseen and unknown atmospheric hazards. They provide a means of early detection and allow firefighters to take precautionary steps to protect themselves and the citizens they serve. This capital project will allow the Fire Department to ensure the replacement of this critical safety equipment and manage health and safety over the long term. There is a continual need to actively manage gas detectors in order to protect the health and safety of firefighters. Wear and tear on the internal electronic components of gas detectors at incidents and during training are major stressors. The electrochemical sensors within gas detectors are always ‘working’ as they are constantly exposed to the atmosphere. These factors are compounded when continual advancements in technology render legacy gas detectors obsolete. After five-years of service, replacement is warranted in order to ensure reliability and optimum performance. By reinvesting in gas detectors the District will be making significant strides towards maintaining this critical safety equipment. The life-cycle costs have been integrated into the District’s equipment replacement plan and will be funded by annual reserve contributions. Vehicle-Extrication Protective Equipment Vehicle extrication equipment is a significant expenditure and staff have integrated the equipment into the reserve-funded replacement program. The automotive industry is constantly working to reduce weight and improve the strength of vehicle structural components. The introduction of high strength low alloy steel and hydro-formed parts has yielded significant advancements. Jaws of life can now become obsolete in as little as five-years. Scheduled replacement is required in order to ensure these challenges are met. This capital project will allow the District to ensure the replacement of this critical safety equipment over the long term. Fire Hose and Appliance The two primary standards that govern the use, care and replacement of FHA are NFPA 1962 and WorkSafe BC Part 31. These standards require ongoing maintenance and testing. If FHA is physically leaking or otherwise becomes damaged replacement is typically required. During a pre-budget audit of firefighting equipment in 2019, it was evident that a significant amount of firehose and appliances (FHA) was in poor condition or past the end of its service lifecycle. Major renewal of equipment has been prioritized and this is the final step in the 6-year process. 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay | 97 CAPITAL PLAN | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY ENGINEERING AND PUBLIC WORKS Capital Purchase/Project Facilities Capital Program Municipal Hall Refurbish (carry-over) Building | $1,057,200 Asset Type 2021 2022 2023 2024 2024 Municipal Hall Refurbish - Furniture Equipment Tod House Improvements (carry-over) Building Marina Structural Repairs (carry-over) Building Work Order Management Infrastructure (carry-over) Equipment 1538 Monterey Capital Repairs Facilities Contingency Transportation Safety Improvements Pavement Management Program Storm Sewer Rehabilitation Storm Sewer - New Assets Uplands Sewer Separation Active Transportation Program Electric Vehicle Stations McNeill Bay/McMicking Point Shoreline Protection Foreshore Infrastructure University Drive Connection Pathway Building Building Road Road Drainage Drainage Drainage Road Road Road Road Road - 165,000 363,000 425,000 25,000 35,000 50,000 500,000 605,000 270,000 - - - - - - - - - - - - 180,000 625,000 270,000 - - - - - - - - - - - 50,000 500,000 50,000 500,000 50,000 50,000 600,000 612,000 1,346,000 1,599,400 1,860,400 2,129,200 2,406,000 690,000 420,000 800,000 850,000 - - - - - 5,395,000 2,500,000 7,538,500 7,538,500 200,000 204,000 208,100 212,300 216,500 50,000 30,000 50,000 158,200 - - 50,000 1,200,000 50,000 50,000 - - - - - - - - - - Total Engineering Services Capital | $10,724,400 | $5,823,400 | $12,452,000 | $11,600,000 | $4,134,500 Carry-over Price Change Year Change New Item FACILITIES CAPITAL PROGRAM Municipal Hall Refurbish In the 2019 - 2023 Financial Plan, Council approved a number of capital projects related to Municipal Hall renovations: • Main Door Replacement - | $35,000 spanning 2019 – 2020 Fire Alarm Replacement - | $40,000 spanning 2019 – 2020 • • Carpet Replacement - | $86,000 spanning 2019 – 2020 • Painting - | $130,000 spanning 2019 – 2020 Did you know? 94% of respondents supported current or increased municipal building maintenance in the 2021 District of Oak Bay Budget Questionnaire.

Phase two is the administrative area and the basement office areas. The administrative office area has not been updated since 1983, the furniture and workstations are well beyond their life expectancy. There is floor tile under the carpeted areas that contain asbestos which should be remediated. The electrical components of the building need to be upgraded to meet today’s load demand requirements. The existing space does not provide for an efficient or effective workspace without a reorganization. The request for Municipal Hall infrastructure funds follows the Moore Wilson recommendation of providing funding to the building to extend the working life and allow Council the opportunity to plan for infrastructure replacement. This proposed renovation budget and the subsequent annual repair budget funding for this facility will extend the Municipal Hall working life ten to fifteen years. This estimate is based on the quality of new materials being upgraded, workspace planning, and the opportunity to upgrade building infrastructure such as electrical, insulation and some minor structure repairs. There is no point in pursuing seismic upgrading to this building as the cost is prohibitive compared to the cost of the replacement of the facility which would meet current code. Tod House Improvements (partially contingent on grant funding) In 2019, the District engaged a consultant to identify practical solutions for the conservation of the Tod House consistent with best heritage practice. The consultants completed and delivered an assessment to the District in 2020. The assessment identified approximately | $300,000 - | $400,000 in deferred maintenance repairs that were high priority and an additional | $400,000 - | $500,000 to conform to heritage conservation best practices. In late 2020, the Province of British Columbia introduced a grant program entitled the Community Economic Recovery Infrastructure Program (CERIP). The program included a Unique Heritage Infrastructure stream which focused on the conservation, repair, and rehabilitation of cultural heritage infrastructure. The program funds 100% project costs. The District submitted a grant application and is expecting to hear back in spring 2021. The District submitted a grant application and received the response in March of 2021 that this grant application was unsuccessful. Marina Structural Repairs (carry-over) The District-owned (and leased out) marina buildings need ongoing maintenance to keep them operational. The marina facilities are currently leased to Oak Bay Marine Group Ltd. The lease expires at the end of 2022. The District of Oak Bay is preparing to negotiate a new 30 year lease. A recently-completed draft Facility Condition report identifies a need to repair asphalt and concrete, replace two hot water storage tanks, and repair buried drainage pipes at an anticipated cost of | $182,100. Significant additional repairs are anticipated to be needed in the immediate future ( | $422,076 in 2021; | $175,099 in 2022; | $619,891 in 2023 and | $266,058 in 2024). 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay | 99 CAPITAL PLAN | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY Work Order Management Infrastructure (carry-over from 2019) This project was approved in the 2019 Financial Plan but no spending has occurred to date. This capital project will add workstations for the Foremen/Lead Hands in Public Works including two new workstations, and modernization of existing workstations. Currently, work-order management and maintenance management is conducted using traditional paper based methods. These paper-based records are then integrated into the computer-based management system, creating an unnecessary duplication of work. This project was deferred as it has become necessary to reconsider workstation orientation as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This project may be deferred to 2022 accordingly. 1538 Monterey Capital Repairs (new) The District owns the house at 1538 Monterey Avenue. In 2020, the District signed a lease for the house in which the District committed to addressing major exterior issues such as problem tree removal, drainage issues, water and sewer hookup and shed structure. Facilities Contingency This contingency budget would be used for unexpected capital expenditures. In early 2020 the heaters in the mechanic’s shop failed. It was a 25 year old heavily used forced air heater. The system heated the 3-bay garage area, a fab shop and office area. The heater was assessed as unrepairable. Installation of a new energy efficient radiant heating system. This system is expected to reduce energy consumption by approximately 50%. Reduced costs from the reduction in energy consumption will exceed the capital cost of the new system over the life of the asset. Transportation Safety Improvements This program aims to deliver projects to improve on safety for all road users within the district. Projects delivered under this program include crosswalks, traffic calming, intersection improvements, and other safety- related capital works. In 2021 this program will deliver wheelchair ramps at approximately 5 locations, design of safety upgrades at 5 intersections, an updated pedestrian and sidewalk master plan, and various other safety improvements. 100 | 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay DISTRICT OF OAK BAY | CAPITAL PLAN Pavement Management Program The road surface rehabilitation program, known in Oak Bay as Pavement Management, has been ongoing for several years. The aim is to develop a sustainable management program that achieved a specific service level while maintaining best value for money. The District’s Pavement Management Study, completed in 2013, identified over | $2M of road rehabilitation would need to occur each year in order to maintain the pavement condition identified in that year. Did you know? 95% of respondents supported current or increased road pavement maintenance in the 2021 District of Oak Bay Budget Questionnaire. Road Pavement Maintain (135) 45% Decrease (15) 5% Increase (151) 55% Storm Sewer Rehabilitation This program captures the refurbishment or replacement of Storm Sewer Mains that have reached end of service life. Based on asset management program targets, the program gradually increases capital expenditures for Storm Sewer Rehabilitation to | $1.1M per year. The program has been underfunded in recent years: the 2016 budget was | $212,000, the 2017 budget was | $117,000 (funded from reserves) and the 2018 budget was | $265,000. Consistent and predictable funding for Storm Sewer Rehabilitation is essential to ensure that capital projects are done efficiently and with best value for money. This funding commitment allows a more cost effective planned approach to repairs and rehabilitation, as opposed Did you know?

This budget includes: • a sub-catchment modelling & condition assessment of St. Patrick Pump Station which will determine the requirements related to outfall relocation, and a McNeill Bay erosion project requirement • new storm main assets for Victoria avenue 2021 Sub-catchment modelling & condition assessment of St. Patrick Pump Station New Storm Main - Victoria Avenue 2021 Total Cost | $30,000 | $240,000 | $270,000 This area of Victoria Avenue currently has no storm sewers. As a result, stormwater flows through the sanitary sewer system and to the Wastewater Treatment Plant. This project would support the District’s commitment to reduce its inflow and infiltration as Core Area Liquid Waste Management Plan. Uplands Sewer Separation (Partially Grant Funded) The Uplands neighbourhood currently has a single sewer system that accommodates both sanitary sewage and stormwater flows. During heavy rainfall, the storm water volume exceeds the capacity of the system and a combination of stormwater and raw sewage discharges into the shallows ocean waters at the Rutland Road and Humber Road pump stations. Separating combined sewers and eliminating overflows at the Humber and Rutland pump stations is necessary under British Columbia’s Municipal Wastewater Regulation. In October 2016, the District of Oak Bay’s Council committed to a plan to separate combined sewers in the Uplands. The plan involves constructing approximately 5km of new storm mains, progressively diverting stormwater flows from homes and from catch basins to the new storm sewers. This plan has the added benefit of reducing the volume of stormwater in the sanitary sewer system, enabling the District to take positive steps towards meeting its sewer flow commitments under the Core Area Liquid Waste Management Plan. Refreshed estimates for the project was prepared in early 2020: Humber Construction Rutland Detailed Design Rutland Construction Total | $7,500,000 | $395,000 | $15,077,000 | $22,972,000 Class B Class B Class C The District submitted an application to the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Grant Program (ICIP) in 2020.

Electric Vehicle Stations At the January 30, 2020 Special Meeting of Council, Council asked staff to include an initiative in the 2021 – 2025 financial plan to install electric vehicle charging stations. At the January 25, 2021 Regular Council meeting, Council reviewed a number of options and the construction of stations are expected to occur in 2021. Council also resolved to levy a | $1 per hour user fee for the electric vehicle stations. This may offset lifecycle cost as revenues may be reinvested in infrastructure replacement. McNeill Bay/McMicking Point Foreshore Erosion Mitigation This project includes two separate studies identifying options for mitigation of ocean erosion on McNeil Bay and McMicking Point. The project will incorporate considerations from new Sea Level Rise Study. Year 2021 2022 2023 Component Project definition, concept planning, public engagement Preliminary and detailed design Construction Amount | $30,000 | $50,000 | $1,200,000 The construction costs are unknown at this time and will be better defined once detailed design is complete. This infrastructure is new infrastructure and as such would require an increase to the ongoing operating budget. Foreshore Infrastructure The natural areas along the foreshore of the District - including Willows Beach, Oak Bay, McNeill Bay and other areas - are extremely popular for walkers. The metal railings used for pedestrian safety in those areas are exposed to the elements, especially salt water spray. This results in accelerated corrosion and failure of the railings. As part of an ongoing safety program, the District conducts periodic railings maintenance to refurbish or replace these railings. This annual program also addresses minor repairs to stairs and other foreshore access points. University Drive Connection Pathway The District partnered with University of Victoria (UVic) to submit an application to the BC Active Transportation Infrastructure Grant Program for the University Drive Connection Pathway. The District was successful in this application and has been awarded a maximum grant of | $316,380. This grant is being remitted to UVic who is managing the project and will own and maintain the infrastructure. In 2020, approximately 50% of the work was complete and thus the budget of | $158,200 represents approximately 50% of the remaining grant funds. This project includes a new 215 meter long and 3 meter wide two-way bicycle pathway and the replacement of 200 meters of existing asphalt pedestrian pathway. 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay | 103 CAPITAL PLAN | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY Asset Type 2021 Vehicle | $65,000 PUBLIC WORKS Capital Purchase/Project #89 Parks dump box truck Replacement (carry-over) #97 Garbage Truck Replacement (carry-over) #18 Flat Deck Crane Truck Replacement (carry-over) #10 Crew Van Replacement (carry-over) #78 Crew Van Replacement (carry-over) #96 Mower Replacement (carry-over) #27a Medium Salt/Sand Spreader Replacement (carry-over) #4 Front End Loader Replacement (carry-over) #5 Single Axle Dump Replacement (carry-over) #58 Flat Deck Replacement (carry-over) Vehicle Vehicle Vehicle Vehicle Equipment Equipment Vehicle Vehicle Vehicle #69 Parks Field Sweeper Replacement (carry-over) Vehicle #79 Parks Crew Pickup Replacement (carry-over) Vehicle Public Works Fencing (carry-over) Land Impr. #70 Crew Van Replacement (carry-over) #31 Vac Leaf Machine Replacement #82 Single Axle Dump Truck Replacement #26 Midsize Hydrovac Unit Replacement #36 Dump Replacement #72 Flusher Truck Replacement #50 Parks Small Tractor Replacement Vehicle Vehicle Vehicle Vehicle Vehicle Equipment Land Impr. #77 Parks Curbster Garbage Truck Replacement Equipment #38 Chipper Replacement #42 Boulevards Mower Replacement #44 Mower Replacement #76 Mower Replacement #83 Flat Deck Replacement #86 Small Mower Trailer Replacement #25A Belly Plow Replacement #8 Locators Pick Up Truck Replacement #17 Tractor Replacement #41 Garbage Truck Replacement Total Public Works Capital Plan Vehicle Equipment Equipment Equipment Equipment Vehicle Vehicle Vehicle Equipment Vehicle 2022 2023 2024 2025 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 90,000 340,000 75,000 100,000 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 60,000 40,000 20,000 65,000 105,000 10,000 12,000 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 90,000 120,000 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 405,000 355,000 178,000 100,000 100,000 40,000 28,000 225,000 140,000 110,000 60,000 40,000 25,000 57,300 75,000 140,000 120,000 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - | $1,858,300 | $605,000 | $312,000 | $210,000 | $405,000 Carry-over Price Change Year Change New Item 104 | 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay DISTRICT OF OAK BAY | CAPITAL PLAN VEHICLE AND EQUIPMENT REPLACEMENT DESCRIPTIONS Unit # Vehicle/Equipment Unit # 89 97 18 Vehicle/Equipment Pick-up truck with dump box Garbage Truck Crane flat deck material trans- porter Supply van Supply van Fields and boulevard mower Salt and sand spreader Description of use Description of use Parks operations at work sites as needed Daily solid waste pick-up Public works operations, capital and servicing Public works operations, capital and servicing Public works operations, capital and servicing Parks operations Public works operations 10 78 96 27a 4 5 58 69 79 70 31 82 36 72 50 77 38 42 44 76 83 86 25a 8 17 41 Front-end loader Dump truck Crew support truck Field maintainer Pick-up truck Van Leaf pickup machine Single Axle dump truck Utility truck with dump box Freightliner flusher truck Parks Small Trailer Parks Curbster Garbage Truck Vermeer chipper Mower Mower Side winder mower International flat deck Mower trailer Snow plow attachment Pick-up truck Tractor Garbage truck Public works operations, capital and servicing, primarily in public works yard for loading trucks and bins Public works operations, capital and servicing, primarily roads rehabilitation Public works operations, capital and servicing, primarily concrete rehabilita- tion Parks operations Parks operations Public works operations, traffic services support Public works operations used in annual leaf pick-up program Public works operations, primarily Public works operations Public works operations, storm/sanitary sewer flushing Parks operations Parks operations Parks operations Parks operations Public works operations, capital and servicing, primarily construction crew Parks operations Public works operations Public works operations Parks operations Curbside solid waste collection 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay | 105 CAPITAL PLAN | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY DISTRICT OF OAK BAY | CAPITAL PLAN SEWER UTILITY Capital Purchase/Project Utility Access Holes Sewer Capital - New Assets Sewer Main Rehabilitation Total Sewer Capital Plan Asset Type Sewer Sewer Sewer 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 | $65,200 100,000 560,000 | $67,800 150,000 710,000 | $69,100 - 598,400 | $70,500 - 610,000 | $72,300 - 630,000 | $725,200 | $927,800 | $667,500 | $680,500 | $702,300 Carry-over Price Change Year Change New Item Utility Access Manholes There are 1,316 utility access holes.

This funding is to enable staff to complete cross connection control and backflow prevention work to protect the quality of the District’s water. Watermain Replacement A portion of the District’s 115 km of water main are rehabilitated or replaced each year as part of the water distribution system master plan. The 2022 plan for water main rehabilitation represents a significant increase in output. This change comes in response to the significant backlog of water infrastructure work identified in the District’s asset management work between 2016 and 2019. The Water Master Plan, followed by the staff’s significant work in 2020 to flesh out a more robust capital improvement program for water infrastructure, enables the District to accelerate much needed water main replacements. This acceleration represents the first step in a multi-year program that aims to address the maintenance backlog and sustain the current levels of service for water distribution. Did you know?

New Service Connections As residents request new service connections for their homes to the water system, Engineering and Public Works staff work together to estimate, plan, construct and close out these mini-projects. Though these service connections are completed on cost-recovery basis, this budget line item provides the funding for planning purposes related to parts and services in preparation for this work. Water Distribution System Remote Monitoring System This project would include the installation of new SCADA remote monitoring equipment at the pressure reducing valves at Lansdowne and Middowne stations, in order to properly monitor and control water pressure in several of Oak Bay's pressure zones and identify water losses. This work will include longer term options analysis and costing for system-wide remote monitoring upgrades. North Oak Bay Pump Station Consolidation and Water Main Upgrades This multi-year project comes from a major recommendation from the Water Supply System Master Plan. Currently in the options analysis/project definition phase, the aim of the project is to define a consolidation and renewal program of several pump stations and mains in North Oak Bay. Water Distribution System Studies Capital Projects (new) There are new projects that we will require funding to pursue, as part of the District's water distribution system capital improvement program.

The life expectancy of the equipment is 30-40 years, and it has now been in service for nearly 47 years. The existing installation, while grandfathered, does not meet current electrical codes and replacement parts are no longer available. The District currently owns this equipment. Replacement of the equipment would ensure we are compliant with current electrical codes, and ownership of the transformer would transfer to BC Hydro (meaning BC Hydro would be responsible for maintenance and replacement in the future). In addition, phase protection against single phase disruptions would be installed, protecting expensive equipment that can often require replacement after such events. Electronic Road Sign for Oak Bay Recreation Centre This project would see the replacement of the electronic road sign on Cadboro Bay Rd which can be updated with current pertinent information for the public. The sign is currently inoperable and the company which manufactured the sign has since gone out of business. Due to its age and other challenges it has been deemed unrepairable. OBRC Parking Lot Paving This project involves re-paving the main parking lot (upper and lower). The current condition of the parking lot is such that waiting much longer will potentially require a significantly more costly renovation. Windsor Park Tennis Court Resurfacing This project involves crack repair and resurfacing of three tennis courts at Windsor Park. This work is required to maintain the courts in a safe, playable condition. Henderson Building Maintenance Planned maintenance includes washrooms, hot water tank, and roof exhaust fans. Maintenance in 2022 includes replacement of the gym floor and the on demand water heater. Monterey Building Maintenance Planned maintenance includes washrooms and kitchen. OBRC Arena, Lounge, & ISF Roof Replacement at OBRC This project involves replacement of the roof over the arena, indoor sports field and Sports View Lounge. This project can be phased if required.

One machine is a demonstration model, purchased used and handed down from OBRC around seven years ago. It is a large machine, not sized properly for the areas it is used for. The second machine was purchased at unknown date and time but is estimated to be around 15 years old. The average life expectancy for floor scrubbers can vary from 6-10 years depending on environment, usage and maintenance. Both units have surpassed their expected lifecycle and require a significant investment to get running effectively again. It would be a better use of funds to invest in a new machine, consolidating two machines into one properly sized machine, lower annual operating and repair costs, and reset the lifecycle. The new, more modern machine will be more efficient with battery, chemical, and water consumption. Ongoing maintenance costs for a new unit will be lower early in lifecycle, only having to replace normal wear and tear parts. Staff will have an easier time using the machine. They will be able to do a better job, in less time, with less cleaning product. OBRC Chiller Replacement This project involves replacement of the chiller, which is a significant piece of the refrigeration infrastructure in the arena. The chiller is at the end of its expected lifespan, and needs to be replaced during an Arena shutdown year. A failed chiller was the root cause of the incident in Fernie, BC which claimed three lives.

Card Printer Replacement This project involves replacement of three pass card printers, one at each of the main recreation centres. This project will be evaluated in 2021 to ensure timing for the replacement is appropriate Parks Tree Inventory Software This project involves purchase of software to collect and maintain data for trees in the community. This is a recommendation of the Urban Forest Management Strategy and is noted in the 2018-2022 Implementation Plan approved by Council. Fields Aerator This project involves purchase of a deep tine aerator/verti-cutter to maintain sports fields in good condition. Currently the District borrows an old piece of equipment from the District of Saanich, but it is becoming costly to maintain. OBRC Desert Air Replacement This project involves replacement of the dehumidification unit in the pool. The unit has been requiring costly repairs on a more regular basis. When the unit is not functioning well the air quality in the pool suffers, leading to patron complaints, employee health concerns and potential long-term damage to the building structure. OBRC Equipment This project includes replacement of an air handling unit and an ice edger.

Lafayette Park Irrigation This project involves installation of digital controls to the irrigation system, as has been done in other major park spaces in the past few years. This provides for efficient use of staff time. Cattle Point Maritime Meadow Protective Fencing Cattle Point is a popular destination for hikers, dog walkers, boaters and others seeking to connect with nature and to enjoy the spectacular views of volcanoes, islands and mountains off our shore. The open areas between the parking lot and the sea contain a very rare type of meadow. This meadow is home to a unique group of animals and plants, some found in few other places on earth. It is also an ecologically significant area, one of national conservation importance and one that is under considerable strain and at risk or disappearing forever. We have reached the point where the Cattle Point meadows are under severe strain and at risk of being lost forever if not managed carefully. Eight endangered plant species are found here, a very large number for such a small area. Cattle Point is also home to several beautiful flowering plants that only grow in these types of meadows. The meadows are very sensitive to foot traffic during the wet season (October to June) and are ex- tremely fragile during the months of April, May and June.

For example, when a road is built, the District must then maintain that road and keep it clear of debris. Furthermore, often the community forms an expectation that the capital service will continue in perpetuity and thus the infrastructure will be replaced at the end of its life. As a result, staff endeavour to present the full life-cycle costs of capital budget items so that Council may consider the entire financial impact of budget approval. Below you will find the new capital items being considered in the scope of this financial plan. “New” capital does not include capital expenditures for maintaining or replacing existing capital services. For instance, the replacement of an existing road is not a “new” capital expenditure because the ongoing operating and maintenance costs of that capital will already be integrated into the operating budget. “New” capital includes a brand new capital service or an enhancement to existing capital services.

It does not include expenditures made for capital, on debt principal or transfers to or from reserves. Local governments may budget for an accounting surplus or deficit but not a budget deficit or surplus. See the definition of a balanced budget. Accrual: An accounting method which measures the financial performance and position of an organization by recognizing economic events when they happen, regardless of when the related cash actually changes hands. For instance, revenue is recognized in the financial statements when earned, not when received. Accumulated Surplus: The accumulated surplus is a pool of accumulated funds resulting from all historical budgetary surpluses. Budgetary surpluses result in funds remaining in accumulated surplus (unappropriated) or transferred to reserve (appropriated). Appropriated: When a fund is appropriated, it is subject to certain restrictions on what the fund can be used for. Balanced Budget: A financial plan where the sum of current revenue, transfers from reserves and debt proceeds, equals the sum of current operating expenditures, debt principal payments plus capital expenditures. Capital Asset: An asset that has physical substance, is used to supply a service, lasts longer than a year and is not for sale in the ordinary course of operations. Capital Expenditure: The expenditure of monies for the purchase or construction of a capital asset. Deferred Revenue: Refers to payments received in advance for services which have not yet been performed. The most common form of deferred revenue in municipal accounting consists of Development Cost Charges which are advanced payments for future capital services needed as a result of growth. Financial Plan: This term is used interchangeably with “budget” but will also usually refer to the 5-year budget Bylaw. Forced growth: Increased costs that the District must incur to continue to provide existing services at the same service level. For instance, collective agreement increases, inflation and contractual increases are forced growth factors. Forced growth is not increases to service delivery costs resulting from elective changes or enhancements to existing programs. 118 | 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay DISTRICT OF OAK BAY | GLOSSARY Fund: A pool of money set aside for a specific purpose. FTE (Full Time Equivalent): A statistic to compare staffing levels between Departments, organizations, or years. It is calculated by dividing the total number of hours that one full-time staff member would work during a year. LGDE (Local Government Data Entry): The LGDE forms provide a standardized financial measure of local government activities over the previous fiscal year. Local governments must annually submit to the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing their forms by May 15. These forms are a standardized presentation of a local government's financial position and activities, such as assets, liabilities, revenue, expenditures, over the course of the previous fiscal year (based on the audited financial statements). Life-Cycle Costs: Full life-cycle costs refer to the total costs incurred by a piece of capital during the entirety of its useful life. For instance, the full life-cycle costs would include the acquisition or construction cost, maintenances costs, and the cost of ongoing annual repairs and maintenance for continued provision of the capital service. Liability: Liabilities are present obligations a reporting entity has to others arising from past transactions or events, the settlement of which is expected to result in the future sacrifice of economic benefit. Municipal Finance Authority (MFA): The Municipal Finance Authority of British Columbia (MFA) was created in 1970 to contribute to the financial well-being of local governments throughout BC. The MFA pools the borrowing and investment needs of BC communities through a collective structure and is able to provide a range of low cost and flexible financial services to our clients equally, regardless of the size of the community. The MFA is independent from the Province of British Columbia and operates under the governance of a Board of Members appointed from the various Regional Districts within the province. New Construction Taxation Revenue: Taxation revenue that results from taxable land or buildings that were not subject to taxes in the previous year. For example, newly built taxable buildings, previously exempt taxable property, newly subdivided land, or valuation increase due to zoning amendments. Official Community Plan: Under the Local Government Act Section 875, an OCP is a statement of objectives and policies to guide decisions on planning and land use management, within the area covered by the plan, respecting the purposes of local government. Operating Costs: Expenses which are related to the operation of a business, or related device, component, piece of equipment or facility. 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay | 119 GLOSSARY | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY Revenue: Income from business services and fees. RFP: A Request For Proposal is issued at an early stage in a procurement process, where an invitation is presented for suppliers to submit a proposal on a commodity or service. Service Plans: These plans depict the operating costs/revenues and related performance measures of a District Department. SOFI (Statement of Financial Information): The SOFI is a financial statement prepared pursuant to the Financial Information Act. The SOFI contains audited financial statements as well as other mandated schedules including the schedule of remuneration and expenses and the schedule showing payments made for the provision of goods or services. Special Initiatives: One-time operating projects that are outside the normal course of work performed by staff. Sustainable infrastructure replacement funding: this refers to the annual funding that is re- quired so an asset can be replaced at the end of its useful life without borrowing. 120 | 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay DISTRICT OF OAK BAY | GLOSSARY APPENDIX A: PRELIMINARY 2020 FINANCIAL RESULTS Revenue Property Value Taxes Boulevard Frontage Taxes Grant In Lieu of Taxes 1% Utility Revenue Property Tax Penalties and Interest Grants (Operating) Grants (Capital) Investment Income Miscellaneous Revenue Municipal-Regional District Tax Facilities Department Revenue Finance Department Revenue Building and Planning Department Revenue Engineering Department Revenue Public Works Department Revenue Parks, Recreation and Culture Department Revenue Sewer Utility Fees Water Utility Fees Total Revenue 2020 Budget | $26,530,000 2020 Preliminary | $26,525,158 215,300 53,200 220,300 127,400 530,500 866,700 825,000 15,300 154,000 429,900 53,200 975,600 27,100 1,603,400 8,921,700 1,370,600 4,628,800 215,418 77,529 220,371 156,913 4,209,323 936,824 834,759 7,239 66,621 401,064 49,388 847,502 61,338 1,596,610 4,797,002 1,366,587 4,829,931 YTD % Preliminary Variance 100.0% 100.1% 145.7% 100.0% 123.2% 793.5% 108.1% 101.2% 47.3% 43.3% 93.3% 92.8% 86.9% 226.3% 99.6% 53.8% 99.7% 104.3% | $(4,842) 118 24,329 71 29,513 3,678,823 70,124 9,759 (8,061) (87,379) (28,836) (3,812) (128,098) 34,238 (6,790) (4,124,698) 76,987 376,131 | $47,548,000 | $47,199,576 99.3% ( | $92,424) 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay | 121 APPENDIX A | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY APPENDIX A: PRELIMINARY 2020 FINANCIAL RESULTS CONTINUED Operating Expenses 2020 Budget 2020 Preliminary YTD % Preliminary Variance Corporate Administration | $2,377,800 | $2,198,291 Oak Bay Tourism Facilities Finance and IT Policing Fire Protection Building and Planning Engineering Services Public Works 260,000 195,100 1,398,400 5,112,400 4,706,300 1,098,600 1,270,900 3,695,500 138,500 160,205 1,284,662 4,565,489 4,839,102 801,680 1,264,567 3,572,088 Parks, Recreation and Culture 13,678,200 10,649,319 Library Sewer Utility Water Utility Fiscal Debt Interest Contingencies Major Crimes Contingency Special Projects Total Operating Expenses Add: Transfers from Reserves Deduct: Capital Expenditures Transfers to Reserves Debt Principal Total 1,202,400 849,300 3,646,500 75,500 134,400 962,400 725,000 1,301,000 1,200,414 574,964 3,136,214 86,385 134,378 10,835 - 215,370 42,689,700 34,832,463 14,882,700 5,747,586 (12,105,300) (7,493,100) (142,600) | $- (5,904,577) (10,800,572) (142,594) | $1,266,959 92.5% 53.3% 82.1% 91.9% 89.3% | $179,509 121,500 34,895 113,738 546,911 102.8% (132,802) 73.0% 99.5% 96.7% 77.9% 99.8% 67.7% 86.0% 114.4% 100.-% 1.1% 0.0% 16.6% 81.6% 38.6% 48.8% 144.1% 100.0% 296,920 6,333 123,412 3,028,881 1,986 274,338 510,286 (10,885) 23 951,565 725,000 1,085,630 7,857,240 9,135,114 (6,200,723) 3,307,472 (6) ( | $1,266,959) These preliminary financial results are unaudited.

The District uses various funds to account for its revenues and expenditures. The revenue in each fund may be spent only for the purpose specified in the fund. Each fund belongs to one of five categories: general, parks & recreation, sewer, water, or reserve. General funds are used for general government and protective services. Recreational funds are used for day to day operating of the District’s Parks, Recreation and Culture department. Water and Sewer funds are self-financed utilizes, except for a general fund contribution to the sewer fund. Both utility funds are used for operating and capital purposes. Reserve funds accumulate revenue and interest that will be used to pay for major capital expenses in future years. All funds (general, sewer utility and reserves) are accounted for on the accrual basis. Sources of revenue are recognized when earned. Revenue unearned in the current period is reported on the balance sheet as deferred revenue. 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay | 123 APPENDIX B | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY APPENDIX C: FINANCIAL PLAN BYLAW THE CORPORATION OF THE DISTRICT OF OAK BAY BYLAW NO. 4792 A Bylaw respecting the financial plan for the years 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, AND 2025 The Municipal Council of The Corporation of the District of Oak Bay in open meeting assembled enacts as follows: 1.

Funding Sources Property Value Tax Distribution Permissive Tax Exemptions 1. Funding Sources Revenue from Property Value Taxes - Objectives and Policies 1.1. The Municipality has a property tax base of which 97.6% of the value is in the Residential class. This concentration of property taxes within the residential calls enhances the dependability as revenue source. Property taxation is a highly dependable and easy to administer revenue source. Fees and charges, however, may enable ratepayers to exercise choice in consumption, thereby controlling the financial impact of that choice. Such a choice does not exist within the property taxation system. The objective of Council, therefore, is to achieve a desired balance between utilizing property taxation revenue. This balance considers the benefits of the revenue dependability vs the desire to restrain property taxation growth. Property taxes will be used to balance the budget after first examining the potential for sustainable revenues from other sources. Revenue From Parcel Taxes - Objectives and Policies 1.2. A parcel tax is a tax levy on land that is not a function of the assessment. Only in limited circumstances is a parcel tax an alternative to a property value-based tax. It can only be applied to properties receiving a particular service and cannot be used for the funding of general services. The objective of Council with regard to the parcel taxes is to ensure that its use fairly in relation to the benefits conferred by the service it funds. Council policy to date has been to use the parcel tax only to fund the cost of maintaining boulevards on specific streets that are serviced by the Municipality. The parcel tax is based on frontage. Revenue From Fees - Objectives and Policies 1.3. Fees and charges account for a significant portion of the District’s revenue. The largest component of user fee revenue is generated from the District’s recreation programs. The objective of Council is to ensure that recreation user fee revenues cover all the direct program costs at a minimum, and a portion of overhead costs if possible. The District aims to recover 100% of its solid waste disposal and collection costs through the solid waste fee. The Municipality also operates a water distribution system. Its objective is to cover the utility costs on with a user fee based on consumption. The Municipality’s sewer system is also operated as a utility. Approximately 70% of the municipal costs are recovered via water consumption based user fee, with the remaining funded through property taxation. The District also levies a sewer user fee to recover 100% of the Core Area Wastewater operating costs. Debt and capital costs are funded via property taxation. 126 | 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay DISTRICT OF OAK BAY | APPENDIX C Revenue From Other Sources - Objectives and Policies 1.4. Revenue in the “Other Sources” class consists primarily grants in lieu of taxes and developer contributions. The use of developer contributions is often specifically prescribed in an agreement or by bylaw. Grants in lieu of taxes are incorporated into revenue forecasts prior to property taxes being considered. Proceeds From Borrowing - Objectives and Policies 1.5. The objective of Council is to maintain its long term debt servicing costs at a manageable level by replacing infrastructure on an incremental “pay as you go” basis. Council policy is to limit the creation of long term debt to the financing of large capital projects which cannot efficiently be undertaken on an incremental basis, or where such an approach would not be adequate to meet requirements with respect to public safety, health or senior government regulations. Property Value Tax Distribution 2. Non-residential properties represent a small proportion of the total tax base. Taxing other classes at a high multiple of the residential rate would be of relatively small benefit. The municipal business tax rate as a multiple of the residential tax rate, therefore, is low relative to most local governments throughout British Columbia. There is no property in the Industry class, and only a small amount in the Recreation class. The objective of Council is to distribute future property value tax increases equitably among the classes of property after non-market change assessments have been considered. The policy is to adjust the tax rate ratios each year so that the increase on each property class is equal after non- market change assessments have been removed. There is one property in the Farm class. The policy is to set the Farm class tax rate to derive the same tax yield as if the property were classified as a residential assessment. Permissive Tax Exemptions 3. The objective being to distribute the tax burden fairly among properties receiving municipal services, Council makes very little use of its authority to grant permissive tax exemptions. The policy to date has been to grant permissive exemptions only for land and improvements appurtenant to property already exempted by statute (e.g., churches), portions of municipal land leased or licensed to a non- profit organization providing a service complementary to municipal services, and in one case, an institution of childhood learning not statutorily exempt. 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay | 127 APPENDIX C | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY APPENDIX D: 2019 - 2021 CONSOLIDATED BUDGETS AND ACTUALS Revenue Property Value Taxes Boulevard Frontage Taxes Grant In Lieu of Taxes 1% Utility Revenue Property Tax Penalties and Interest Grants (Operating) Grants (Capital) Developer Contributions Investment Income Miscellaneous Revenue Municipal-Regional District Tax Facilities Department Revenue Finance Department Revenue Building and Planning Department Revenue Engineering Department Revenue Public Works Department Revenue Parks, Recreation and Culture Department Revenue Sewer Utility Fees Water Utility Fees Total Revenue 2019 Actual | $24,650,807 2020 Actual | $26,525,158 2020 Budget | $26,530,000 2021 Budget | $28,469,200 208,215 53,198 228,748 198,509 460,910 1,738,296 - 955,127 68,729 178,987 386,231 59,833 712,193 43,846 1,543,095 8,912,265 1,160,680 4,119,817 215,418 77,529 220,371 156,913 4,209,323 936,824 - 834,759 7,239 66,621 401,064 49,388 847,502 61,338 1,596,610 4,797,002 1,366,587 4,829,931 215,300 53,200 220,300 127,400 530,500 866,700 - 825,000 15,300 154,000 429,900 53,200 975,600 27,100 1,603,400 8,921,700 1,370,600 4,628,800 221,300 53,300 221,700 167,800 3,050,900 6,923,700 186,000 562,500 15,300 150,000 396,200 51,700 907,600 27,100 1,669,800 4,750,600 1,414,900 4,798,300 | $45,679,486 | $47,199,576 | $47,548,000 | $54,037,900 128 | 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay DISTRICT OF OAK BAY | APPENDIX D APPENDIX D: 2019 - 2021 CONSOLIDATED BUDGETS AND ACTUALS CONTINUED Operating Expenses Corporate Administration Oak Bay Tourism Facilities Finance and IT Policing Fire Protection Building and Planning Engineering Services Public Works 2019 Actual | $2,181,005 2020 Actual | $2,198,291 2020 Budget | $2,377,800 2021 Budget | $2,747,800 178,987 213,400 1,225,919 4,815,267 4,687,642 986,214 1,082,172 3,379,588 138,500 160,205 1,284,662 4,565,489 4,839,102 801,680 1,264,567 3,572,088 260,000 195,100 1,398,400 5,112,400 4,706,300 1,098,600 1,270,900 3,695,500 150,000 211,100 1,500,500 5,475,400 4,884,500 1,099,800 1,451,100 3,825,600 Parks, Recreation and Culture 12,788,399 10,649,319 13,678,200 12,113,400 Library Sewer Utility Water Utility Fiscal Debt Interest Contingencies Major Crimes Contingency Special Projects Total Operating Expenses Add: Transfers from Reserves Deduct: Capital Expenditures Transfers to Reserves Debt Principal Total 1,192,670 276,607 2,856,300 71,616 134,378 - - 1,200,414 574,964 3,136,214 86,385 134,378 10,835 - 1,202,400 849,300 3,646,500 75,500 134,400 962,400 725,000 1,128,300 802,500 3,700,700 91,400 134,400 478,200 805,000 85,124 215,370 1,301,000 1,307,000 36,155,288 34,832,460 42,689,700 41,926,700 2,628,731 5,747,586 14,882,700 16,936,500 (3,541,773) (7,650,606) (142,594) | $817,957 (5,904,577) (10,800,572) (142,594) | $1,266,959 (12,105,300) (21,110,600) (7,493,100) (142,600) (7,794,500) (142,600) | $- 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay | 129 APPENDIX D | DISTRICT OF OAK BAY 130 | 2021 - 2025 Financial Plan | District of Oak Bay DISTRICT OF OAK BAY | FINANCIAL LEGISLATION, POLICY AND BEST PRACTICES

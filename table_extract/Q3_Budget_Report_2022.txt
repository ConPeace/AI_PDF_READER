$REPORT TO: Mayor and Council FROM: Director of Finance and Asset Management MEETING DATE: Oct 19, 2022 SUBJECT: Third Quarter Budget Report 2022 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF REPORT Overall, the District is forecasted to finish the year within spending limits. Staff are currently forecasting a | $1.4M operating budget surplus (see Schedule B for details). Underspending is forecasted to occur in most operating departments. Most of this underspending is modest. Much of the forecasted surplus is due to better-than-expected revenues such as investment revenue and building permit revenue. Revenue Expenses Capital Expenditures 2022 Budget 52.1M 31.2M 20.5M 2022 YTD 45.1M 42.1M 7.2M YTD % 86.6% 69.9% 38.0% 2022 Forecast 52.4M 42.1M 11.8M Forecast % 100.6% 94.1% 62.3% Capital expenditures are forecasted to be underspent ( | $11.8M forecasted vs | $18.9M budget). Forecasted capital expenditures ( | $11.8M) would set a new capital spending record for Oak Bay. Some capital projects are expected to exceed budget: • Oak Bay Recreation Centre Roof - | $2,009,400 forecasted vs. | $1,450,000 budget (overage approved by Council April 11, 2022). • Pavement Management Program - | $2,100,000 forecasted vs | $1,599.000 budget. Staff have elected to overspend this budget since there is significant capital underspending elsewhere (with same reserve funding sources). • Public Works Yard Urgent Repairs - | $90,000 vs | $0 budget. Capital Contingency budgets will be utilized from the Facilities Capital Program and Parks, Recreation, and Culture capital programs. • Electric Zamboni Replacement - | $250,038 vs | $0 budget (overage covered by Public Works Equipment Replacement funding underspending see Schedule F). BACKGROUND/HISTORIC CONTEXT On May 9, 2022, Council approved the District’s 2022-2026 Five Year Financial Plan Bylaw which included funding for ongoing District operations, capital expenditures, and special initiatives to advance Council Priorities. The District’s financial and work planning processes provide for a second and third quarter budget report to support transparency. Budget reports are typically placed on the second Council meeting in the month following the quarter close. As the Regular Council meeting for the end of September was cancelled due to the election, this report is being published on the District’s website to ensure Council and the public can access the information in a timely manner. Third Quarter Budget Report 2022 – October 19, 2022 Page 1 of 3 On October 26, 2020, Council adopted the District's Department Budget Transfer policy. This policy requires the disclosure of budget transfers in specific situations. Schedule F has been prepared in accordance with this policy. On June 29, 2020, Council adopted amendments to the District's Sustainable Procurement Policy that required disclosure of any single payments, with a value over | $25,000. Schedule G meets this requirement. ADVISORY BODY RECOMMENDATIONS WITH MINUTES EXCERPT (IF APPLICABLE) None. STRATEGIC PRIORITY SUPPORTED Achieve Sustainable Service. FINANCIAL IMPACT The District is forecasted to finish the year in a stronger net financial position than the Five- Year Financial Plan contemplated. This is due to the deferral of capital spending and the forecasted | $1.6M operating budget surplus. Net financial position, beginning of year Net transfer to (from) reserves Net transfers to (from) surplus Net financial position, end of year 2022 Budget 58.4M (11.6)M - 46.8M 2022 Forecast 58.4M (3.0)M 1.4M 56.8M Variance - +8.6M +1.4M +10.0M IAP2 FRAMEWORK ENGAGEMENT (INDICATE WITH X) X INFORM CONSULT INVOLVE COLLABORATE TIMELINE/PROCESS/NEXT STEPS Council will receive preliminary full year financial results during the 2023 budget deliberations and audited financial statements in spring of 2023. No financial plan bylaw amendments will be recommended by staff unless forecasted spending exceeds spending authority limits set by the bylaw. At the May 9, 2022, Council Meeting, Council directed that staff draft a Budget Surplus Allocation Policy for Council consideration. This policy is currently being developed. If Council approves the draft as currently written, a portion of the forecasted | $1.4M budgetary surplus would be allocated to the Financial and Service Level Stability Reserve, another portion would be allocated to the Council Priority Initiative Reserve, and the remainder would be allocated to the infrastructure renewal reserve.

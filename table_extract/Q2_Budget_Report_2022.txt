$DISTRICT OF OAKJCBAY REPORT TO: Mayor and Council FROM: Director of Financial Services MEETING DATE: July 13, 2022 SUBJECT: Second Quarter Budget Report 2022 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF REPORT Overall, the District is forecasted to finish the year within spending limits and without the use of contingency funds. There is some risk that the District will need to amend its Financial Plan to authorize additional use of the Infrastructure Renewal Reserve (see Schedule F). Staff are currently forecasting a | $1.6M operating budget surplus (see Schedule B for details). Underspending is forecasted to occur in most operating departments. Most of this underspending is modest. Much of the forecasted surplus is due to better-than-expected revenues such as investment revenue and building permit revenue.

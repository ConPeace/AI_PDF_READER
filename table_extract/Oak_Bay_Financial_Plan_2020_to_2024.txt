Specifically we recognize the Lekwungen-speaking people known today as the Songhees and Esquimalt Nations, and that their historic connections to these lands continue to this day. The District is located on the southern tip of Vancouver Island in British Columbia. The City of Victoria borders Oak Bay’s west boundary, and the District of Saanich lies to the north. Oak Bay is one of 13 member municipalities comprising the Capital Regional District. The University of Victoria is partially located in the District, as is a small portion of Camosun College. Additional community landmarks include other public and independent schools, two golf courses, a marina, a yacht club and a luxury boutique hotel. Oak Bay is a beautiful seaside community that is defined by its residential neighbourhoods, village centres with local businesses, historic character, mature tree canopy, accessible shorelines and abundance of green space. All of these features combined make Oak Bay one of the world’s most desireable communities in which to live. Financial Plan 2020 - 20243 FINANCIAL LEGISLATION, POLICY, BEST PRACTICE Financial Planning Legislation Much of the District’s Financial Planning Process is guided by the Community Charter S. 165. The Charter requires the District to adopt a Five Year Financial Plan Bylaw before May 15 annually. Such a bylaw must: 1. Set out proposed expenditures, funding sources, and transfers between funds, 2. Set policy and objectives related to identified funding sources, distribution of property taxes and the use of permissive tax exemptions, 3. Disclose amounts for specific expenditures such as debt interest, debt principal, capital expenditures, and 4. Disclose amounts for specific funding sources such as property taxes, parcel taxes and fees. Council may amend the Financial Plan at any point during the year but will only do so if authorized expenditure limits are likely to be exceeded. Balanced budget: current revenues, including transfers from reserves, must be sufficient to support current expenditures, including transfers to reserves. Expenditures include those of a capital nature and debt principal. Example Balance Budget Revenues Operating expenses Accounting surplus Add: transfers from reserves Less: Capital expenditures Less: Debt principal payments Less: Transfers to reserves Balanced budget: | $1,000,000 (900,000) 100,000 50,000 (60,000) (10,000) (80,000) - Notice that an accounting surplus differs significantly from a budgetary surplus. A balanced budget included expenditures that are not considered expenses under Public Sector Accounting Standards such as capital expenditures and debt principle payments. Financial Planning Policy and Best Practice Annually, the District endorses a budget approach that Staff use to carry out budget deliberations. At the November 12, 2020 Regular Meeting of Council, Council endorsed a budget approach with the following principles: 1. Service Level approach: Staff prepare the budget to deliver community services at the standard directed by Council and legislation. Staff do not increase nor decrease service levels unless directed by Council or external regulation. Staff endeavour to describe the financial impact of service level decisions so that Council can be empowered to make service level decisions with all available information. Furthermore, Staff endeavor to fund and deliver services in the most cost effective manner. Service delivery expectations will be further considered and refined by Council in 2020. 2. Funding source alignment: Staff recommend aligning expenditure funding sources as follows: • Predictable, stable, and ongoing expenditures should be funded using predictable, stable revenues • such as property taxes and user fees. Infrequent, volatile, or less predictable expenditures should be funded using reserves or debt. This will help avoid steep tax increases for capital expenses or significant operating initiatives. Reserves balances should be maintained with annual budget transfers so funds are available for large, infrequent expenditures. Financial Pan 2020 - 2024 4 Budget Core Projects Operating Capital Operating Capital Predictable/stable expenditures Infrequent/volatile expenditures Taxation, user fees Surplus, reserves, grants 3. Project budget carry-over: The five-year Financial Plan authorizes expenditures over five years. Thus, on January 1, 2020, staff are authorized to continue spending under the Financial Plan Bylaw 2019, No. 4727. Projects that were underway in 2019 will continue, and projects authorized to begin in 2020 will begin. Operations are not paused while the District embarks on adopting a new Five Year Financial Plan. 4. Five year expenditure authorization: Staff endeavor to prepare a Five Year Financial Plan that is as accurate as possible and that reflects Council direction and service-level expectations. This way, staff work continues while the Financial Plan is being refined in the first quarter of the year. The 2020 Financial Plan will outline general operations as well as specific initiatives planned for the entire five year cycle. Council approval of the Financial Plan Bylaw will be considered endorsement and direction for the listed projects, initiatives and operating expenditures that make up the rolled-up totals contained in the bylaw. 5. Financial Plan bylaw transparency: The Financial Plan bylaw is summarized at a very high level in order to maximize operational flexibility while retaining expenditure authorization. The published Financial Plan document will not form part of the bylaw but will expand the bylaw detail for transparency. 6. Life-cycle costing: Staff will integrate annual life-cycle costs into the Financial Plan when new capital expenditures are approved. Life-cycle costs include the additional operating costs required to maintain the asset as well as annualized asset replacement contributions. • • Legal spending authority Summarized at a high level for operational flexibility Financial Plan Bylaw Financial Plan Document • Minimal legal basis • Expands bylaw in great detail for transparency and accountability Financial Plan 2020 - 20245 7. New development taxation (NDT) revenue: NDT revenue is derived from new buildings or newly subdivided lots. In other words, NDT is taxation revenue from assessed values that did not exist in the prior year. As the District develops, so will the pressure on existing services and infrastructure required to serve new citizens. The District will use NDT revenue to fund the incremental costs of new development including expanded operating expenses and infrastructure maintenance and replacement. Staff recommend that the District does not use NDT revenue to reduce the tax burden for existing citizens. The practice of using NDT revenue to reduce the tax burden for existing taxpayers is unsustainable and will result in sharper future + | $+ | $Rezoning Subdivision + | $Building Permit Light Infrastructure Maintenance - | $New Operating Costs - | $Heavy Infrastructure Maintenance - | $Infrastructure Replacement - | $Financial Plan 2020 - 20246 FINANCIAL PLANNING AND REPORTING TIMELINE January February March April May June July August September October Financial Planning January 31: Grant in Aid Deadline February: Budget deliberations March 1: Final Police Budget March 31: Regional District budget deadline 1st, 2nd 3rd reading of Financial Plan Bylaw Audit Financial Reporting May 14: Statutory deadline, Financial Plan Bylaw May 15: Local Government Data Entry (LGDE) submissions due June 30: Quarter 2 end June 30: Statement of Financial Information (SOFI), Annual Report deadline Quarter 2 budget reports October 31: Permissive tax exemption bylaw deadline September 30: Quarter 3 end Quarter 3 budget reports November Water and Sewer rate deliberations December December 15: Statutory deadline, Library budget Pre-audit Purchasing Bylaw/Policy The authority to make purchasing decisions and to bind the Corporation contractually rests with Council unless delegated by bylaw. The District’s “Delegated Authority of Administrative Functions Bylaw, 2004” delegates this authority to specific staff within limits. In 2019, this bylaw was amended to delegate such authority to specific Managers, Directors and the Chief Administrative Officer. The District’s purchasing bylaw refers to a recently adopted (2019) Sustainable Procurement Policy which sets purchasing limits and processes for staff. The policy also outlines procedures for asset disposal and emergency expenditures. This policy complies with M.A.S.H sector trade requirements and purchasing case law. [References: Bylaw No. 4239, Delegated Authority of Administrative Functions Bylaw; Special Meeting of Council December 12, 2019] Reserve Fund Bylaw & Reserves and Surplus Policy The Community Charter empowers Council to establish, by bylaw, reserve funds. Funds placed in these reserve funds may not be spent except for the reserve fund purpose specified in the bylaw. Use of funds are authorized via the annual Financial Plan bylaw. In early 2020, Council adopted the “Reserve Funds Bylaw, 2020”. This bylaw consolidated already established reserve funds and repealed ten historical reserve fund bylaws. The seven reserve funds specified in this bylaw include: (1) Machinery and Equipment, (2) Fire Machinery and Equipment, (3) Heritage, (4) Land Sale, (5) Park Acquisition, (6) Capital Works, and (7) Alternative Transportation. Please see the Capital Plan section of this Financial Plan for further information on fund balances and purposes. Financial Plan 2020 - 20247 The District adopted the Reserves and Surplus Policy in 2018. This policy outlines general objectives of reserves and good reserve background information. [References: Bylaw No. 4747, Reserve Funds Bylaw, 2020; Regular meeting of Council January 27, 2020] Investment Policy In early 2020, the Council adopted the District’s Investment Policy, 2020. Section 183 of the Community Charter lists the security types that the District may invest in. These securities include: (1) securities of the Municipal Finance Authority (MFA), (2) pooled investment funds under section 16 of the Municipal Finance Authority Act, (3) securities of Canada or of a province, (4) securities guaranteed for principal and interest by Canada or by a province, (5) securities of a municipality, regional district or greater board, (6) investments guaranteed by a chartered bank, (7) or deposits in a savings institution, or non-equity membership shares of a credit union. Prior to 2020, the District’s investment policy had not been updated since 2004. The 2004 policy restricted the District’s investments to MFA pooled funds, chartered banks, or Canadian treasury bills. The new policy sets diversification limits and articulates investment objectives in the following order: (1) preservation of capital, (2) liquidity, and (3) return on investment. [References: Investment Policy, 2020; Regular meeting of Council January 13, 2020] Asset Management Policy In 2018, Council adopted the District’s Asset Management Policy. The policy captures Council’s direction regarding asset management practices and infrastructure renewal in the District. The fundamental aim of an asset management approach is to create a planning and execution framework that delivers Sustainable Service Delivery. Some of the guiding principles found in the policy include: • • Sustainable service delivery Sustainable service delivery may require innovative solutions, but will leverage lessons learned in other communities • A key deliverable of the asset management program will be decision making tools, which will enable Council to manage infrastructure risk as a core part of capital planning Expense Reimbursement Policy The District has adopted and expense reimbursement policy that governs staff reimbursement for travel and accommodation in the course of work. The policy objectives is to ensure that travel is properly authorized, care has been exercised to minimize costs and employees are fairly reimbursed for out of pocket expenses. This policy was adopted in 2006 and is due for review. Property Tax Exemption Policy Section 165 of the Community Charter requires the District to set out the objectives and policies related to the use of permissive tax exemptions in its annual Financial Plan Bylaw. The following is an excerpt from the Financial Plan Bylaw 2019, No. 4727: “The objective being to distribute tax burden fairly among properties receiving municipal services, Council makes very little use of its authority to grant permissive tax exemptions. The Policy to date has been to grant permissive exemptions only for land and improvements appurtenant to property already exempted by statute (e.g., churches), portions of municipal land leased or licensed to non-profit organization providing a service complementary to municipal services, and in one case, an institution of childhood learning not statutorily exempt.” Financial Plan 2020 - 20248 Grant in Aid Policy In 2015, a grant policy working group was brought together to work on a grant policy that would provide Council with guidance on the evaluation of grant in aid applications. Council adopted the policy in 2015. Some of the policy’s features can be summarized as follows: • Grants should align with the OCP and strategic priorities • Grants should primarily benefit Oak Bay residents • Grants should not subsidize services normally funded by other levels of government • One time grants are given preference over recurring • Grants should not be provided to an individual Whistleblower Policy – Reporting, Investigation, and Protection At the Regular Meeting of Council of February 10, 2020, Council adopted the District’s Whistleblower Policy. The purpose of the policy is to facilitate the disclosure of wrongdoing that is contrary to the public interest. A whistleblower policy encourages a culture where wrongdoing can be addressed quickly and potentially before reputational damage. It is an important tool in deterring or halting financial wrongdoing.

Operating projects do not include capital projects. The initiatives below are a combination of Council-directed priority initiative as well as Staff recommended initiatives. Initiative progress is recorded and tracked in the Corporate Plan. Initiatives Funding These projects are not integrated into the ongoing operating budget since the operating budget is funded by taxes and user fees. Integrating these projects into the operating budget would result in significant tax and user fee volatility. These projects are funded by accumulated surplus and grants and therefore do not directly impact tax rates. Using accumulated surplus to fund expenditures is not generally sustainable since the fund has a finite balance. Legislation prevents the District from budgeting transfers to the accumulated surplus fund. Therefore Council exercises discretion when approving the use of accumulated surplus fund. Staff propose that these projects be funded as proposed in the chart below. However, actual completion of these projects, and the related expenditures, will likely carry forward to future years. The initiative budget average from 2020-2024 is approximately | $450,000. Historically, the District has returned budget surpluses near this mark. DRAFT: VERSION 1 Financial Plan 2020 - 202411 COUNCIL PRIORITIES The District’s annual budget cycle provides for Council to, each year, either confirm or adjust Priorities. Council’s 2019-2022 Priorities were identified early in 2019 and confirmed on June 10, 2019 and again on January 16, 2020. Council’s Priorities are as follows: • Ensure access to diverse housing options within the built environment by reviewing and planning for community needs while reflecting Oak Bay’s unique character; • Achieve sustainable service by integrating an Asset Management Program within a long-term Financial Plan; • Provide service excellence by optimizing operational effectiveness and fostering public engagement; • Enhance and promote quality of life and sense of place by stewarding the community’s history, landscape, culture and amenities within the context of Southern Vancouver Island; and • Demonstrate leadership in fostering community health and resilience by committing to economic, environmental and social sustainability within the District’s operations and decision-making. Each year, Council decides which initiatives to fund to advance Priorities. Council’s decisions are then reflected in budget documents, including annual budgets and the Five Year Financial Plan. Upon budget approval, funded initiatives are listed in the District’s Corporate Plan, which in turn drives Departmental work plans. Periodic quarterly updates provide Council with progress reports, thus supporting both transparency and accountability.

One of these housing options is to allow for secondary suites. The Secondary Suites Study is intended to review the policies and regulations necessary for secondary suites to be permitted in Oak Bay. The Oak Bay Official Community Plan includes content that speaks to developing a policy and regulatory framework to permit secondary suites as a way of providing affordable housing in the community, and Council also included secondary suites in their 2017-2018 strategic priorities. As a result, the Secondary Suites Study is intended to review the options for secondary suites as one possible form of housing within the community. The study will address key items identified through the process, and provide options that benefit the community and property owners. New policies and regulations will be identified including, for example, possible updates to the Zoning Bylaw. Housing Needs Report (carried over from 2019) The Housing Needs Report initiative represents a foundational process required to implement Council’s Strategic Priority: Ensure Access to Diverse Housing Options Within the Built Environment. The report will provide information on the demand and supply of housing, as well as current housing stock, population, income and economic data, and will identify housing gaps and needs by housing type. Engagement with the community will be undertaken to share the information in the report. The Housing Needs Report provides the basis, together with directions from the District’s policy framework, to proceed with further review of strategic housing initiatives in order to address housing needs in Oak Bay. Infill Housing - Neighbourhoods (approved for 2020) The Infill Housing – Neighbourhoods initiative is intended to identify infill housing opportunities and specific housing options based on housing needs for neighbourhoods. Infill housing forms include duplexes, triplexes, laneway houses, garden suites, as well as heritage conversions. This initiative would develop an approach to provide for identified priority housing needs. Preparation of policy criteria and design guidelines for integration of infill housing in neighbourhoods, together with regulatory (zoning bylaw) changes, would inform a community engagement process to consider actions that lead to the addition of more diverse housing options in Oak Bay. [Reference: Budget Estimates Committee, April 17, 2019] Village Area Plans (approved for 2020) This initiative will result in area plans being prepared for the Oak Bay Village/Cadboro Bay Road corridor and Secondary Village areas. The Area Plans will consider opportunities for housing in the form of additional multi-family residential and mixed-use development in the village centres and corridor areas. Area plans are proposed for the areas identified and will address housing policy, residential form and density, urban design (guidance for both building and streetscape design), transportation, servicing, and the economics of public and private investment in these key areas of Oak Bay. This project will support Council’s Strategic Priority “Ensure Access to Diverse Housing Options Within the Built Environment”. Furthermore, the District’s Official Community Plan, provides policy direction to consider the provision of a range of housing opportunities. [References: (1)Budget Estimates Committee, April 17, 2019, (2) Official Community Plan, 2014, Section 4.3.1] Comprehensive Zoning Bylaw Update (scheduled for 2022-2023) This initiative will address a range of issues respecting the zoning bylaw and the regulation of land use in the District. The update will implement the policy directions provided in the Official Community Plan (OCP), bring the document up to date respecting legislation, best practices, and also address issues that have arisen over the years since the last version of the Zoning Bylaw (No. 3531, 1986). Financial Plan 2020 - 2024 14 The Zoning Bylaw update will comprise phases of research, review and analysis, draft bylaw revisions, community engagement, and preparation of a final Zoning Bylaw update for the legislated approvals process. The Zoning Bylaw provides for the permitted use of land in Oak Bay, as well as the conditions (or regulations) related to the use of land such as lot size and coverage, height, and yard setbacks, for example. The update is intended to produce a more user-friendly document through content reorganization, use of plain language, and to allow for more simplified interpretation and calculations when applying regulations within zones. Implementation of any new policy directions arising from reviews related to housing options will be included in the update to the Zoning Bylaw.

[Reference: Asset Management Strategy, January 24, 2019 Special Committee of the Whole] Storm Sewer Master Plan (2022-2023) This Master Plan will incorporate an updated storm sewer hydraulic model, a growth capacity analysis, and up- to-date asset management and capital improvement plan. [Reference: Asset Management Strategy, January 24, 2019 Special Committee of the Whole] Sanitary & Storm Sewer CCTV Inspection (carry-over) In 2015, Council approved a five-year sanitary sewer and a 10-year storm sewer condition assessment program. The 2019/2020 portions of the work began in the fall of 2019 and will be completed in Q1 of 2020. Due to an increased focus in asset management program activities and an emphasis on sewer condition assessment, Staff and the District’s contractors are likely to be able to complete the storm sewer portion of the program early, about 5 years ahead of schedule, in summer of 2020. Completion of the storm and sanitary sewer condition assessment programs are essential pre-requisite activities to complete sewer Master Plans and develop reliable asset management and capital improvement plans Emergency Plan (2020-2021) The Province is modernizing the Emergency Program Act and all of the associated processes. The strategic plan for the Oak Bay Emergency Program is to enable the District to keep pace with the subsequent changes to legislated accountabilities. This budget item will be used to update emergency plans and processes, buy equipment and materials, and train staff and volunteers at a pace that enables the District to maintain a preparedness level appropriate to its size and responsibilities. It will be used in conjunction with the Program’s associated budget items and external funding opportunities. Pavement Condition Assessment (New for 2020 – 2021) A Pavement Condition Assessment (PCA) will help the District support its effort for comprehensive asset management and sustainable infrastructure replacement funding. PCA’s are utilized by most municipalities to document and prioritize the timely and effective management of road assets. A PCA is comprised of the collection, conversion and entry of roughness and surface distress data via a specialized vehicle. This assessment would encompass approximately 105kms -the District’s paved road network. Facilities Master Plan (New for 2020-2021) Building on the work done related to facilities condition assessment, a strategic Facilities Master Plan details timeframes, costs and options for facilities upgrades or replacements. A Facilities Master Plan needs to be developed with decision making options and risk assessment disclosed publicly and allowing for Council to set direction.

Council and Staff comprehension and compliance with current FOIPPA legislation is critical in daily municipal operations. Human Resource Plan Implementation The purpose of the HR plan is to ensure that the District of Oak Bay has adequate human resources to meet the District’s strategic goals. It’s about ensuring that we have the right people with the right skills at the right time to deliver on Council’s priorities. In addition, it is critical that we position the District of Oak Bay as an employer of choice to attract and retain the best talent to ensure future success and sustainability. The various initiatives of the plan will focus on HR planning, attracting and retaining great staff, promoting performance excellence and commitment to employee safety and wellness. 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 Learning and Development Employee Engagement Performance Feedback and Evaluation Health and Wellness Recognition Policy Review Occupational Health and Safety Total -Integrated into operating budget- | $20,000 | $10,000 - - - - | $20,000 - -Integrated into operating budget- -Integrated into operating budget- | $14,000 | $30,000 | $74,000 - - - - - - - - | $20,000 - - - - - Records Management (approved in 2019 – 2023 Financial Plan for 2019 - 2023) Records Management is an integral component of municipal operations for legislative and productivity reasons.

[Reference: Budget Estimates Committee, April 17, 2019] Emergency Evacuation Plan (New for 2020) In 2019, the Oak Bay Emergency Program submitted a grant application to the Community Emergency Preparedness Fund for its participation in a regional evacuation route planning project. The grant application was approved in early 2019 and the regional team issued a joint Request for Proposal in late 2019. The work has now been awarded and is currently underway. [Reference: Regular Council Meeting December 10, 2018] DRAFT: VERSION 1 Financial Plan 2020 - 202417 Network Security Audit (New for 2021 & 2024) The District is entrusted with important and sensitive personal information and has a legislated obligation to protect this information. Furthermore, the District’s data is a valuable resource which supports the delivery of community services. This audit will identify potential security vulnerabilities and provide recommendations to ensure the District’s systems are protected to industry standards. Such a security audit should be conducted once every three years. Fire Master Plan A Fire Master Plan will provide the District with a holistic platform that goes well beyond Fire Underwriters Survey and the traditional OBFD Strategic Plan. In order to develop such a plan the District would need to secure the services of a consulting firm. Such a firm will must have extensive experience in fire and emergency services, as well as corporate planning, governance, organizational issues, law and communications. The key output from the consulting team would be the ability to connect fire services and community needs with the greater capital region fire operational and political context.

The UWSS has made significant progress over the past three years working with the District, scientific community, the Province of BC and other stakeholders. Until 2019, the majority of work was focused on strategies for studying deer populations, densities, space use, habitat selection, distribution and movement patterns, equipment acquisition and approvals by senior governments of immuno-contraception methods. In 2019, the emphasis shifted to initiating immuno-contraceptive field work. The Province provided a grant in the amount of | $31,560 which was matched by the District of Oak Bay.

The District’s Official Community Plan recommends preparation of this plan given the passion for parks and recreation in the community, and the need for continued upgrading and maintenance of facilities. The project’s deliverables will include: • A community survey to assess existing use patterns, satisfaction and needs in relation to parkland, sports fields, trails/paths, playgrounds, other park amenities, recreation centres, and recreation programs. • An analysis of existing and forecasted demographics and best practices to support the needs analysis. • Identification of existing and future community needs for different types and locations of parkland, park amenities, paths/trails, recreation facilities and recreation programs, considering the needs of people of all ages and abilities. • Consideration of the need for upgrading the pool or other amenities at Oak Bay Recreation Centre, potentially in partnership with the School District, to satisfy the needs of students as well as all members of the community.

Upon its completion, District staff will be undertaking next steps to develop implementation measures to address climate change, and specifically sea level rise, as warranted by the results of the sea level rise mapping project. DRAFT: VERSION 1 Financial Plan 2020 - 202420 COMMUNITY HEALTH AND RESILIENCE Electric Vehicle Station Options Analysis At the January 30, 2020 Special Meeting of Council, Council asked staff to include and initiative in the 2020 – 2024 Financial Plan to install electric vehicle charging stations. Staff have integrated | $15,000 into the special initiatives budget for the development of an options analysis report as well as | $50,000 in the capital budget. The operating budget has also been increased by | $12,500 starting in 2022 representing incremental operating costs and infrastructure replacement reserve contributions. Urban Forest Management – Garry Oak Inventory The information collected by inventorying the Garry oak and associated ecosystems in Oak Bays natural areas parks will be useful in designing trail networks and will provide a baseline for measuring success of our restoration activities. The collected data is extremely useful and will be reported to the provincial and federal agencies to track the overall recovery or decline of rare plant species in Canada and in Oak Bays natural area parks. The data will also help establish federal funding priorities for recovery activities such as habitat restoration. Coolkit Program The Coolkit program has been developed through the University of British Columbia (UBC) Forestry program. Developed as a toolkit for engaging community residents, its focus is on impacting climate change and urban forestry; with an overall intent to engage the community in a conversation around climate action, which ultimately leads to positive action on both public and private lands. The program is designed to involve everyone from individual residents, to families, entire neighbourhoods, organizations and local governments in determining what climate action they would they would like to focus on. One of the main elements focuses on urban forestry, but previous groups have also included items such as urban food gardens, home improvements, car pooling and other local forms of active transportation. The program is designed to be applicable at the neighbourhood level to achieve the greatest impact.

It is a tax levied on the value of land and improvements (i.e. building and fixtures). Municipalities levy property value taxes based on the tax revenue needs set out in their annual budget (Financial Plan). Property value taxes are calculated by applying a set tax rate against the assessed value of a property. Municipal tax rates are annually set by Council, and the assessed values are set independently by BC Assessment. Tax Stability, Predictability, Collectability In most years, taxation revenue is predictable and stable. The District’s tax base is 96% residential. Therefore, disruptions in non-residential assessments would not disrupt tax revenues enough to significantly impact the predictability of tax revenues. In fact, a uniform and significant reduction in assessed values would be unlikely to disrupt tax revenues. The British Columbia legislated model of property taxation administration is one of the most efficient in the world. Tax revenue collection is highly likely, almost certain in most cases. The Local Government Act requires the District to commence tax sale proceeds in the cases where 3 years of taxes remain unpaid. Section 250 of the Community Charter writes, “Taxes accrued and to accrue on land and improvements... are a charge that, (a) is a special charge on the land and improvements, (b) has priority over any claim, lien, privilege or encumbrance of any person except the Crown…”. Therefore taxes are discharged, at a minimum, when the property changes ownership or during tax sale proceedings. Tax sale proceedings can result in the property being auctioned (although exceedingly rare), which ensures property taxes are highly collectible. Relationship between Assessments and Taxation Municipalities use assessed values to apportion property taxes to individual taxpayers. For instance, if a taxpayer’s assessment represents 5% of the entire taxable assessment base, that taxpayer will pay 5% of the municipal property tax budget. A common misconception is that a significant increase in assessed value will necessarily result in a significant increase in property taxes. It is more important for a taxpayer to consider the assessed value in relation to the average assessment increase. It is possible for one’s assessment to decrease while taxes increase and vice versa. Assessment Change Property Tax Impact Lower than average assessment increase/decrease Individual % tax increase < Total District % tax increase Average assessment increase/decrease Individual % tax increase % = Total District % tax increase Higher average assessment increase/decrease Individual % tax increase % > Total District % tax increase The 2020 Revised Assessment Roll indicates a 5.01% average decrease in residential assessed properties. The property tax increase for 2020 is 6.9%. Therefore properties with an assessment change above -5.01% will incur a tax increase greater than 6.9%. Financial Plan 2020 - 202425 New Development Taxation (NDT) Revenue NDT revenue is derived from new buildings or newly subdivided lots. In other words, NDT is taxation revenue from assessed values that did not exist in the prior year. Staff have estimated approximately | $170,000 derived from New Development Taxation Revenue in 2020. Five Year Property Taxation Forecasts The draft 2020 – 2024 Financial Plan forecasts an average tax increase of 5.53% for the five year horizon and an average increase of 4.94% for 2021 through 2024: Tax increase Tax increase | $to median residential property 2020 6.9% | $207.91 2021 6.4% | $206.60 2022 5.6% | $203.03 2023 4.7% | $171.24 2024 3.7% | $138.35 Average 5.5% | $185.02 Forecasted tax increases are driven by the following factors: | $Increase by cost driver Forced Growth 2020 | $649,687 2021 | $731,900 Infrastructure New Staffing Office 365 Implementation Urban Forest Management Confidential Contingency Fire Department Apparatus Bay Lease Debt retirement Carnarvon Park Building Debt Servicing NEW Initiative - Community Recycling Bins NEW Initiative - Short Term Rental Enforcement NEW Initiative - Electric Vehicle Stations Total | $738,000 | $226,000 | $60,000 | $35,000 - - - - | $300,000 | $375,000 - - | $150,000 | $90,000 - - 2023 | $814,300 | $550,000 | $150,000 - - - - - - 2024 | $767,400 | $277,000 | $150,000 - - - - ( | $277,000) | $290,000 2022 | $763,600 | $850,000 | $150,000 - - - - - - Pending - | $51,000 - - - - - | $1,708,687 | $1,697,900 | $1,776,100 | $1,514,300 | $1,207,400 | $12,500 - - Financial Plan 2020 - 202426 % Increase by cost driver Forced Growth Infrastructure New Staffing Office 365 Implementation Urban Forest Managemnt Confidential Contingency Fire Department Apparatus Bay Lease Debt Retirement Carnarvon Park Building Debt Servicing NEW Initiative - Community Recycling Bins NEW Initiative - Short Term Rental Enforcement NEW Initiative - Electric Vehcile Stations Total | $Increase by cost driver Forced Growth Infrastructure New Staffing Office 365 Implementation Urban Forest Management Confidential Contingency Fire Department Apparatus Bay Lease Debt Retirement Carnarvon Park Building Debt Servicing NEW Initiative - Community Recycling Bins NEW Initiative - Short Term Rental Enforcement NEW Initiative - Electric Vehicle Stations Total 2020 2.7% 3.0% 0.9% 0.2% 0.1% - - - - - - 6.9% 2020 | $79.05 | $89.80 | $27.50 | $7.30 | $4.26 - - - - - - 2021 2.8% 1.1% 1.4% - - 0.6% 0.3% - - 0.2% 0.0% 6.4% 2021 | $89.06 | $36.50 | $45.63 - - | $18.25 | $10.95 - - - 2022 2.4% 2.7% 0.5% - - - - - - - Pending 0.0% 5.6% 2022 | $77.83 | $103.43 | $18.25 - - - - Pending - - - | $6.21 | $1.52 2023 2.3% 1.9% 0.5% - - - - - - - - 2024 2.3% 0.9% 0.5% - - - - -0.9% 0.9% - - 4.7% 3.7% 2023 | $86.07 | $66.92 | $18.25 - - - - - - - - 2024 | $84.81 | $33.70 18.25 - - - - ( | $33.70) | $35.29 - - | $207.91 | $206.60 | $201.03 | $171.24 | $138.35 Boulevard Frontage Taxes The District levies a boulevard frontage tax subject to the “Boulevard Frontage Tax Bylaw, 1982”. Properties identified in this bylaw pay a tax based on taxable frontage. The District’s Park’s crew maintain the boulevards abutting these properties. Financial Plan 2020 - 202427 The draft Financial Plan proposes a 3.6% tax increase which represents increased labour, fuel, and equipment costs. 2016 | $183,725 2017 | $192,766 4.9% 2018 | $199,500 3.49% 2019 | $207,816 4.34% 2020 Draft | $215,300 3.60% Business Improvement Area The District levies a business improvement area tax subject to the “Oak Bay Business Improvement Area Bylaw, 2020”. Properties identified in this bylaw pay a tax based on taxable assessment. Taxes collected from this levy are remitted to the Oak Bay Business Improvement Association. The Oak Bay BIA exists to promote local member businesses and to contribute to the community at large. The BIA’s term expires on December 31, 2024 if it is not renewed with another bylaw. Grant in Lieu of Taxes Federal Payment in Lieu of Tax: Federally owned properties are generally exempt from taxes pursuant to section 125 of the Federal Constitution Act, 1867. Federal properties may, however, be subject to a payment in lieu of taxes pursuant to the federal Payments in Lieu of Taxes Act. Two federally owned, tax exempt properties in the District pay a payment in lieu of taxes: (1) Turkey Head Breakwater, and (2) Trial Island Lighthouse. | $1,934 Turkey Head Breakwater | $3,604 Trial Island Lighthouse Grant in Lieu of Taxes, University of Victoria: The University of Victoria is exempt from taxes pursuant to section 54 of the University Act. The University is situated partially in the District of Oak Bay and partially in the District of Saanich. Annually the Ministry of Advanced Education, Skills and Training distributes a grant in lieu of taxes to local governments with universities. The funds are apportioned based on the proportional assessed value of university property within the municipality. The total grant fund budget has not changed in many years. Actual value of UVic property within Oak Bay is assessed at | $351M. The grant in lieu of taxes is equivalent to approximately 2.2% of the taxation revenue that would be due on | $351M of taxable assessment. The foregone taxes demonstrates the District’s significant investment in post-secondary education. University of Victoria Financial Plan 2020 - 202428 1% Utility Revenue Pursuant to section 644 of the Local Government Act and the Hydro and Power Authority Annual Grants Order, utility companies must pay each municipality 1% of the revenues earned within that municipality in the preceding year. Since this revenue is based on prior year financials and amounts remitted to the City, the budget is very accurate. For 2020, 1% revenues are forecasted as follows: Utility Company Shaw Communications Telus Fortis BC Hydro Total 2019 Budget | $30,454 19,289 43,948 135,057 | $228,748 2020 Budget | $29,300 18,900 35,400 136,700 | $220,300 Change | $-1,154/-3.8% -389/-2.0% -8,548/-19.5% +1,643/1.2% - | $8,448/-3.69% User Fees Section 194 of the Community Charter enables Council to impose a fee in respect of all or part of a municipal service. In general, user fees are charged when the benefit of a service accrues to identifiable individuals and taxes are levied when the benefit of a service accrues broadly to the public. However, Council has the authority to vary the mix and imposing of taxes and users as appropriate. Below are some of the user fees that the District levies. Sewer User Fees: The District levies a sewer user fee to recover 70% of the costs to maintain the municipal sanitary sewer conveyance system. The remaining 30% of such costs are recovered by property taxes. The sewer user fee also partially funds an annual transfer to reserve for capital asset replacement and rehabilitation. Sewer user fees are calculated by multiplying the sewer rate by 60% of water consumption for residential properties. Rates are applied to 100% of the water used by properties that are not residential, have mixed use, or have two water meters. Capital Regional District Sewer User Fee: The District levies a user fee to recover 100% of the costs related to the Core Area Wastewater Treatment Plant. This levy has experienced steep increases for a number of years while the Capital Regional District phases in the cost of construction. In 2021, the treatment plant costs are expected to convert from capital to operating costs. It is expected that the increase in that year will be moderated when compared to historical increases. In 2020, the District is expecting a 17% increase in the requisition cost from 2.0M to 2.6M. Water User Fee: The District levies a water consumption charge and a fixed user fee to recover 100% of the costs related to the provision of retail water. The majority of the costs relate to the purchase of bulk water from the Capital Regional District for distribution to District citizens. The fixed fee recovers 35%, while the consumption fee recovers 65%. For properties with two or less units, the fixed fee is | $0.62 per day or | $226.30. • Garbage • Recreational • Licences & Permits Financial Plan 2020 - 202429 Grants (Operating) The District’s operating grant budget is composed of four main grants: (1) Small Community Grant, (2) Traffic Fine Revenue Sharing Grant, (3) Climate Action Revenue Incentive Program Grant (CARIP), and (4) project-related grants. Grant Small Community Grant Traffic Fine Revenue Sharing CARIP Project-related Grants 2019 Forecast 2019 Budget 2020 Budget Change | $157,960 | $170,000 | $150,000 - | $20,000/-11.8% 202,368 34,475 100,382 202,000 32,000 112,060 223,700 +21,700/+10.7% 34,400 +2,400/+7.5% 122,400 +10,340/+9.2% Total | $495,185 | $516,060 | $530,500 - | $14,140/+2.8% Small Community Grant: This grant is an unconditional grant paid by the Province to the District. The formula that determines the grant amount is complex. The grant is phased out as a community grows. Traffic Fine Revenue Sharing Grant: This grant amount is determined by the total Provincial traffic fine revenue collected in the year prior. Oak Bay’s share of the funds are determined by the District’s policing costs as a proportion of the entire Province’s policing costs. CARIP Grant: The CARIP grant is a conditional grant program that provides funding to local governments that have signed the B.C. Climate Action Charter, equal to 100 percent of the carbon taxes they pay directly to support local government operations. The program encourages investment in climate action. Project related grants: Project grants in 2019 included deer management, Emergency Social Services trailer, and housing needs review. In 2020, project related grants include Union of BC Municipality’s Asset Management Planning grant, the Federation of Canadian Municipality’s Municipal Asset Management Program, and the Urban Deer Cost-Share Program. Grants (Capital) Gas tax: The Administrative Agreement on the Federal Gas Tax Fund in British Columbia took effect on April 1, 2014. The tripartite Agreement between Canada-British Columbia-UBCM replaced the 2005-2014 Agreement and provides the administrative framework for the delivery of federal Gas Tax funding to local governments and other recipients in British Columbia over a ten year period (2014-2024). The Gas Tax fund provides predictable, long-term and stable funding to local governments in British Columbia for investment in infrastructure and capacity building projects. The gas tax allocation table sets out funding through 2024. 2019 | $851,133.48 2020 | $816,756.82 2021 | $816,756.82 2022 | $853,872.73 2023 | $853,872.73 2024 | $890,979.58 In 2014 when the new agreement was signed, the eligible project categories expanded significantly. This prompted many communities to change their gas tax revenue recognition practice. Previously, all gas tax revenues had been deferred and listed as a liability on the financial statements until used for eligible projects at which time the revenue was recognized. Since use of the funds is less restricted, the common accounting practice is to recognize the receipts of funds as revenue immediately. In fact, the District’s 2018 Audit Findings report recommended this accounting practice (see Special Meeting of Council agenda May 6, 2019). Beginning in 2020, the District will change its accounting practice to immediately recognize the receipt of gas tax funds as revenue. Financial Plan 2020 - 202430 Gas tax funds are allocated to the District’s Infrastructure Renewal reserve through the course of this Financial Plan. The 2019 capital grants revenue category has been restated to include all gas tax payments even though the majority of such payments were recorded in the deferred liability account. The purpose of the restatement is to promote fiscal period comparability. Investment Revenue Investment returns have grown considerably over the past five years due to two main factors: (1) increased investment balances, and (2) increased money market performance. Approximately 80% of the District’s portfolio have been invested in the Municipal Finance Authority’s Money Market Fund. Performance on this fund has grown noticeably since 2015. 442,099 174,000 418,239 152,000 2015 Actual 2016 Actual 2017 Actual 2018 Actual 883,881 140,000 Investment Revenues Investment Revenues Budget Cash and Investment Balance MFA money market return % *stated investment returns do not include actuarial adjustments.

The majority of our investment funds belong to reserve funds. Interest earned on these balances must be retained in the reserve funds. As a result staff, have increased the transfer to reserve budget by a corresponding amount: Investment Returns General Revenue | $Transfer to Reserve Total budgetary impact | $2019 Budget | $301,500 -301,500 - - 2020 Budget | $825,000 -450,000 -375,000 - Change +523,500 +(148,500) +(375,000) - Linking investment returns to reserve contributions is crucial for a number of reasons: 1. There is a legislated requirement to ensure investment returns earned by reserve funds remain within the reserve fund. 2. General-revenue linked investment returns can significantly increase tax rate volatility. For instance, should 3. investment returns fall, tax revenues will have to rise to offset the loss. Investment returns from reserve funds are part of the District’s annual, permanent, ongoing funding for infrastructure replacement.

These positions were not fully funded in the 2019 budget since the positions were not filled until part way through the year. The 2020 Financial Plan adds funding for the remaining 0.50 FTE and 0.60 FTE respectively. Deputy Director of Corporate Services Staff recommend that the District fund and fill the Deputy Director of Corporate Services position. Currently there are no resources designated, or available, to fill the statutory requirements of corporate administration in the absence of the Director of Corporate Services who serves as the District’s Corporate Officer. In addition to a lack of succession, the District is experiencing a significant gap in capacity that is required to bring, and maintain, operations to the standards of a modernized local government. There are a wide variety of risks to the organization in not having a Deputy Corporate Officer capable of acting in the role when necessary and assisting during times of high volume. The District has an established Deputy role, however the position has not been funded since July 2019. Committee and Commissions Clerk During the Committees and Commissions Review, the third party consultant recommended consideration of a Committees and Commissions Clerk. Staff are recommending that consideration of this position be postponed until 2021 to allow procedural changes to be fully implemented and assessed in 2020 for resulting efficiencies, prior to determining the service levels required to most efficiently support Council ‘s Committees and Commissions. A staff contingency cost of | $75,000 has been integrated into the 2021 budget. Tuition Reimbursement Program Tuition reimbursement contributes to a culture where learning and skill development are fundamental to individual and group success. It will be a component of the District’s Learning and Development plan that will link to the Human Resources plan. This program will contribute to the District becoming an employer of choice and will increase the District’s success in attracting and retaining great staff. It will also assist in our succession planning efforts.

Staff recommend an increase in auxiliary hours to meet these needs and provide additional support for persons with disabilities. The addition of 620 hours will enable staff to provide support services to adults and children participating in community recreation, as well as children attending af- ter school care programs and summer camps. This initiative began in 2019, with the addition of 289 hours, and the 2020 increase will see support hours rise to a total of 912 hours. Increase Lifeguard Presence - Swim Sessions Staff recommend an increase of 515 auxiliary hours, to reduce the number of single lifeguard sessions. As budget allows, the Aquatics team has been working toward a higher standard of care in our public swim ses- sions. With the approval of this request, the remaining single lifeguard hours will be reduced to 866 annually, from a starting point of 2930 hours in 2016. Enhanced Customer Service at Reception With significant growth in programs and drop-in visits, the volume of transactions and customer interactions has increased exponentially. To maintain our high level of customer service, staff recommend an increase of 210 hours in reception. These additional hours will be used to improve customer response times, both in- per- son and for telephone wait times. These hours will be shared amongst our three main recreation centres, Oak Bay, Henderson and Monterey. The increase will also create more capacity for training and administrative tasks like proofing recreation brochures, managing the Perfect Mind data base content, and streamlining customer content, electronic and otherwise. Financial Plan 2020 - 202460 Enhanced Supervision in Fitness Centres Staff recommend an increase of 75 auxiliary hours during the summer months. Additional supervision will increase the safety of, and assistance to, patrons who attend our fitness centres. Customer education, in the proper use of equipment and in fitness room etiquette, is an activity that optimizes the fitness experience for all of our customers. Urban Forest Management Strategy – Tree Risk Reduction In an effort to reduce incidents involving high risk trees in the District of Oak Bay the municipality has been broken into eight neighborhoods. The Municipal Arborist will patrol one of these neighborhoods annually, on a rotating basis, looking for obvious deadwood, structural deficiencies, and low branches over roadways and sidewalks, sign clearances and will identify any tree that requires (removal) or further assessment. Trees that require further assessment will be evaluated by municipal staff when time permits. A private consulting ar- borist may be contracted as required. Following these patrols the arboricultural crew will spend a period of 10 to 12 weeks annually pruning trees in each of the neighborhoods addressing the highest priority hazards they are qualified to handle. Outside con- tractors may also be hired to perform complex pruning or removals. In addition to these scheduled neighborhood inspections a timely response to residential and internal tree re- quests is also necessary to meet our duty of care. These requests will be prioritized depending on level of risk as determined by the Municipal Arborist or Manager of Parks Services. Financial Plan 2020 - 202461 CAPITAL PLAN Financial Plan 2020 - 202462 ASSET MANAGEMENT AT A GLANCE The District provides numerous capital services for the enjoyment of its citizens and visitors as detailed below. Many of these capital services required significant initial investment. Citizens expect these services to continue uninterrupted well into the future. The District has developed many Master Plans and guiding documents to support the long-term provision of high quality services.

Note 2: Reserve projections do not include anticipation of budgetary surpluses or defecits. Individual reserve fund projections are outlined on the following pages. Financial Plan 2020 - 202465 Climate Action Reserve The District is a signatory of the BC Climate Action Charter. Under the Charter, the District commits to becoming carbon neutral in corporate operations, measuring and reporting progress and creating more energy efficient communities. As a signatory, the District is eligible for to receive 100% of the carbon taxes paid during the year as a rebate. Proceeds from this rebate have been transferred to the District’s Climate Action Reserve since 2012. Major Crimes Reserve Annually the Police Board budgets for a transfer to the major crime reserve. These funds are set aside pursuant to the annual budget request from the Police Board. Fire Machinery and Equipment Reserve Fund The Fire Machinery and Equipment reserve fund was originally establish pursuant to Bylaw No. 3773, “Fire Machinery and Equipment Depreciation Reserve Fund Bylaw, 1993”. This bylaw was recently repealed and replaced by Bylaw No. 4747, the “Reserve Funds Bylaw, 2020”. Money in this fund and interest earned on it shall only be used for extending the useful life, upgrading or replacement of fire machinery and equipment. Two of the Fire Department’s major pieces of apparatus are due for replacement between 2020-2022: (1) Engine with light rescue, and (2) 75-ft Ladder Truck. These vehicles are expected to cost over | $3.2M. The Fire Machinery and Equipment reserve balance was approximately | $1.5M at the beginning of 2020. As a result of these purchases, the reserve is expected to be negative. Staff intend on borrowing from other reserves to fund the purchases. Staff analyzed the annual fire equipment reserve funding levels and determined that this funding needs to be doubled approximately from | $190k to | $370k annually. This will ensure that fire apparatus is funded sustainable for the entire fleet Staff will appropriate a portion of the annual infrastructure renewal reserve funding to increase the fire equipment reserve funding. The Reserve fund is forecasted to remain negative for many years until a healthy and sustainable reserve fund balance can be restored. Heritage Reserve Fund The principal of the Heritage Reserve Fund represents the net profit from the Municipality’s development of the Wessex Close subdivision in 1980-81. Over and above the statutory requirement that monies in the fund be expended only for the purpose of capital projects, the bylaw establishing the Heritage Reserve Fund provides further that with the exception of interest, no monies may be appropriated from the Fund “save those required for the purpose of land development projects and other capital investments designed to augment the net present value of the principal.” Financial Plan 2020 - 202466 Machinery and Equipment The Machinery and Equipment reserve fund was originally establish pursuant to Bylaw No. 2074, “Reserve for Machinery and Equipment Bylaw” and Bylaw No. 3773, the “Machinery and equipment Depreciation Reserve”. These bylaws were recently repealed and replaced by Bylaw No. 4747, the “Reserve Funds Bylaw, 2020”. Money in this fund and interest earned on it shall only be used for extending the useful life, upgrading or replacement of machinery and equipment. Much of the District’s fleet is due for replacement in and will be replaced in the next 5 years. However, reserving funding levels are believed to be sustainable for the long term. For further information on the asset replacement funding, please see the State of Asset Replacement Funding section of this Financial Plan. Parks Acquisition Reserve Fund Under the Section 510 of the Local Government Act, an owner of land being subdivided into three or more lots must either provide park land or pay cash in lieu. Section 188 of the Community Charter requires that such payments are credited to a statutory reserve fund. This reserve fund may only be used for the purpose of acquiring new park lands. Capital Works Reserve Fund This reserve fund was originally established via Bylaw no. 3775, the “Capital Works and Equipment Reserve Fund Bylaw”. This bylaw has since been repealed and replaced with Bylaw No. 4747, the “Reserve Fund Bylaw, 2020”. The primary purpose of the Capital Works Reserve Fund is to provide a means of financing major repairs or replacement of physical assets while moderating tax increases. Annual contributions for water main replacement and sewer rehabilitation are directed to this reserve, among other transfers. This reserve balance was reported as | $21M in the 2018 financial statements but | $6.1M of this has been segregated in its own account below (Upland Sewer Separation Gas Tax Reserve Fund). (See Appendix F) Alternative Transportation Infrastructure Reserve Fund Section 525 of the Local Government Act permits a local government to collect a payment in lieu of off-street parking as a condition of a building permit. These payments must be placed in a reserve. Such payments were deposited to the City’s Village Parking Reserve which was established under Bylaw No. 3631, the “Parking Reserves Fund Establishment Bylaw, 1989”. Subsequent to the establishment of the City’s Village Parking Reserve, legislation was enacted to allow Council to use the reserve for transportation infrastructure that supports walking, bicycling, and public transit, in addition to the provision of new off-street parking. The District then created its Alternative Transportation Infrastructure reserve pursuant to Bylaw No. 4422, the “Alternative Transportation Infrastructure Reserve Fund Establishment Bylaw, 2008”. These reserves were subsequently combined via Bylaw No. 4747, the “Reserve Funds Bylaw, 2020”. Combining the Village Parking and Alterative Transportation Infrastructure reserves enabled Council to use the combined balances of nearly | $1M for either purpose. Financial Plan 2020 - 202467 Infrastructure Renewal Reserve This reserve was established by administrative practice and not by bylaw. The District established this reserve through budget deliberations in 2017. Annually, the District receives approximately | $800k in gas tax funds via the Union of BC Municipalities. These funds are deposited into the infrastructure renewal reserve. In 2019, Council directed that property taxes be increased by 2% so that an annual transfer could be established. The 2020 Financial Plan proposes an increase equal to 2% of taxes for general infrastructure renewal plus an additional 1% for pavement rehabilitation. Approximately 180k of the annual transfer to infrastructure renewal reserve has been appropriated and added to the transfer to fire equipment replacement reserve. This additional | $180k in annual funding ensures fire asset replacement funding becomes sustainable. (See Appendix G). Legacy Trust The Legacy Trust consists of various bequests to the Municipality for specific purposes — i.e. improvements to the Seniors’ Activity portion of the Monterey Centre. The Public Art Fund is also included here. Tod House Trust The Tod House Trust was established to fund repairs to the historic residence at 2564 Heron Street, which used to be jointly owned by the Municipality and the Province. In 2008 the Province gave its share to Oak Bay, but only “for so long as the land is used for the specific purpose of managing the Tod House Heritage Site”. Correspondence with the Province suggests that if the property use were to change, the District will pay to the Province 50% of the market value of the property at the time that its use changed. The Trust is built up from the net rental revenue. Upland Sewer Separation Gas Tax Reserve Fund The District has accumulated and set aside | $6.1M in gas tax funds specifically for the uplands sewer separation project. These funds are classified as a liability in the District’s financial statements due to the public nature of the commitment to this specific project. Therefore, the total dollar value of this reserve fund can be found in Note 3 of the financial statements. Most other reserves are found in Note 7 of the financial statements. Gas tax revenues received subsequent to 2018 have been transferred and will continue to be transferred to the infrastructure renewal reserve. This deferred revenue reserve balance is capped at the estimated cost of the Humber Catchment construction project. Financial Plan 2020 - 202468 DEBT MANAGEMENT – FIVE YEAR FORECAST The District may choose to incur debt to finance capital expenditures. The Community Charter and Municipal Liabilities Regulation establishes debt limits for the District. The maximum amount of debt a municipality may undertake is subject to the liability servicing limit. A municipality may not incur debt if the total annual debt servicing cost is greater than 25 percent of annual controllable sustainable revenues. Municipal long term borrowing in British Columbia must occur through the Municipal Finance Authority (MFA) and the financing must be undertaken by the municipality’s regional district. This legislated relationship creates a joint and several liability between the regional district members. The MFA has the legislated authority to levy taxation on all taxable properties within British Columbia. These factors create a strong institutional and governance framework that helps the MFA retain a triple-A credit rating and exceptionally low borrowing costs on behalf of BC municipalities. When municipalities borrow, principal payments are invested by the MFA. Investment earnings are returned to the borrowing municipality via reduced principal payments. For instance, in 2004, the District borrowed | $4.7M to upgrade the Oak Bay Rec Centre. The debt from this will be paid off in 2023. Over the 20 years, the District’s debt principal will have been reduced by approximately | $1.86M. These debt principal reductions are referred to as ‘actuarial adjustments’. In the 2020 – 2024 Financial Plan, the District’s annual controllable sustainable revenues will exceed | $46M, making its annual liability servicing limit approximately | $11.5M. Annual debt servicing costs are not expected to exceed | $300,000 which amounts to approximately 2.6% of the District’s liability servicing limit. Debt payments including interest and principal for the next five years are forecasts as follows: Year Beginning Balance New Debt* End Balance | $Principal | $Interest | $Total Payments | $Actuarial % Liability Servicing Limit** 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 | $1,362,441 | $1,030,323 | $703,495 | $360,328 | $5,000,000 | $5,000,000 | $1,030,323 | $703,495 | $360,328 | $5,000,000 | $4,853,600 | $163,447 142,594 142,594 142,594 146,400 | $135,778 134,378 134,378 134,378 125,000 | $299,225 276,972 276,972 276,972 271,400 | $168,671 184,234 200,573 217,734 2.6% 2.3% 2.3% 2.2% 2.1% | $737,629 | $663,912 | $1,401,541 | $771,212 *New debt for Carnarvon Park Building with 25-year amortization, presumed debt interest rate of 2.5% **Assumes a 2.5% annual increase to controllable sustainable revenues Financial Plan 2020 - 202469 STATE OF ASSET REPLACEMENT FUNDING This District has made significant progress toward ensuring sustainable asset replacement is supported by permanent, predictable revenue (taxation and utility fees). In 2019, the District increased annual funding by | $1.3M. The draft 2020 Financial Plan increases annual asset replacement funding by an additional | $900,000. Overall, this will result in an additional | $10.4M in cumulative funding being set aside in reserves over the course of the current Council term (2018-2022). A decision to increase taxes by 3% in 2019 and 2020 for asset replacement, will result in an additional | $115M funding over the next 50 years.

Sustainable infrastructure replacement funding is estimated to be | $9.265M in 2020 dollars. The District has made significant progress in closing the infrastructure funding gap since 2017. In 2017, funding levels were estimated be at approximately 43% of sustainable levels. The draft financial plan closes this estimated funding gap completely by 2024.

Staff will need to analyze current funding levels and future needs. Financial Plan 2020 - 202473 Fire Aparatus Replacement Funding - Transfer to Fire Equipment Reserve The District transfers | $190,000 to its Fire Equipment annually. The forecasted opening balance of the reserve is | $1.5M. The District has developed a 25-year capital vehicle and equipment replacement plan. Should the District maintain the current funding amount of | $190,000, the District’s Fire Equipment replacement reserve will quickly become and remain depleted. In order for the District to achieve sustainable, stable reserve funding levels for the Fire Equipment Replacement Reserve, funding levels will need to increase from | $190,000 to | $370,000. This Financial Plan dedicates | $125,000 in existing taxation funding and | $50,000 from annual infrastructure renewal funding to achieve a sustainable funding target. This ensures that sustainable funding targets for fire equipment can be reached without an increase to taxes. Financial Plan 2020 - 202474 Public Works Vehicle and Equipment Replacement Funding – Transfer to Machinery and Equipment Reserve The District currently utilizes a public works vehicle and equipment inventory valued at over | $4.6M. Forecasted spending over the next 25 years is approximately | $12.6M. Annual reserve contributions are currently approximately | $300,000. Left unchanged, contributions over the next 25 years would be | $7.5M, leaving a funding shortfall of approximately | $5M. This Financial Plan increases annual contributions initially to | $350,000 and proposes a gradual 2% annual increase. This funding would ensure that the Machinery and Equipment reserve would remain positive for all 25 years. Police Vehicle Replacement Funding The District’s Police Vehicle Replacement reserve is a sub-balance found in the Capital Works Reserve. In 2019, the District transferred | $35,000 for police vehicle replacement. The 2020 – 2024 Financial Plan increases this amount to | $100,000 by appropriating and dedicating | $65,000 from the infrastructure renewal reserve funding. Reserve balance forecasts indicate that current funding would result in a | $1.6M funding shortfall after 25 years. However, increasing annual funding to | $100,000 will ensure the police vehicle reserve balance will remain stable and positive.

The current equipment is fragile and subject to failure. Staff are proposing to purchase a central processing unit along with new wireless microphones that will provide greater flexibility for a variety of meeting setups in the Council Chambers. The new equipment will reduce or eliminate equipment malfunctions, require less staff time for meeting setups, and support the new operational requirements of providing amplified sound for all Council, Committee and Commission meetings held inside the Council Chambers. This equipment will improve audio provisions for in-person attendees, as well as for those viewing the proceedings via livestream or archived video. Municipal Hall Renovations In the 2019 - 2023 Financial Plan, Council approved a number of capital projects related to municipal hall renovations: • Main Door Replacement - | $35,000 spanning 2019 – 2020 Fire Alarm Replacement - | $40,000 spanning 2019 – 2020 • • Carpet Replacement - | $86,000 spanning 2019 – 2020 • Painting - | $130,000 spanning 2019 – 2020 • Boiler rebuild, Air handling system repairs and electronic furnace controls | $30,000 , 2019 The building repairs were managed in phases with Phase one being completed. Proposed Phase two is the Administrative area and the Basement office areas. The administrative office area has not been updated Financial Plan 2020 - 202477 since 1983, the furniture and workstations are well beyond their life expectancy. There is floor tile under the carpeted areas that contain asbestos which should be remediated. The electrical components of the building need to be upgraded to meet today’s load demand requirements. The existing space does not provide for an efficient or effective workspace without a reorganization. The request for Municipal Hall infrastructure funds follows the Moore Wilson recommendation of providing funding to the building to extend the working life and allow Council the opportunity to plan for infrastructure replacement. This proposed renovation budget and the subsequent annual repair budget funding for this facility will extend the Municipal Hall working life ten to fifteen years. This estimate is based on the quality of new materials being upgraded, workspace planning, and the opportunity to upgrade building infrastructure such as electrical, insulation and some minor structure repairs. There is no point in pursuing seismic upgrading to this building as the cost is prohibitive compared to the cost of the replacement of the facility which would meet current code.

The consultants completed an assessment in late 2019, including: • Drawings • Condition assessment • Photographic survey • Risk assessment • Prioritized recommendations. As detailed project budget has not yet been prepared and will be presented to Council for approval in 2020. Since these details are not currently available, Staff have included a contingency budget of | $342,600 in the Financial Plan which is equal to the available reserve balance. However, it is highly unlikely that the entire reserve balance will be required for the project. Marina Structural Repairs (carry-over) The District-owned (and leased out) marina buildings need ongoing maintenance to keep them operational. The Marina facilities are currently leased to Oak Bay Marine Group Ltd. The lease expires at the end of 2022. The District of Oak Bay is preparing to negotiate a new 30 year lease. A recently-completed draft Facility Condition report identifies a need to, in 2020, repair asphalt and concrete, replace two hot water storage tanks, and repair buried drainage pipes at an anticipated cost of | $182,100. Significant additional repairs are anticipated to be needed in the immediate future ( | $422,076 in 2021; | $175,099 in 2022; | $619,891 in 2023 and | $266,058 in 2024).

Varying timelines, terms and conditions, make the process quite complex. The District currently owns payroll software that may meet the needs of all payroll groups. The District currently outsources the payroll payment process, while the tabulation and data preparation, benefits administration, and data quality control is performed by internal Staff. In 2019, the District paid over | $30,000 in fees to process the payroll payment. Should the District implement payroll software, these fees will be eliminated and could be used to pay for additional needed payroll staffing or support costs. This budget is primarily composed of estimated additional Staff and consultant time to implement the payroll software that has already been acquired. The project has not been fully scoped or costed. Staff will seek further Council approval should the project estimate exceed the initial budget recommendation. Network Switch and other IT Hardware This capital project includes the following multi-year components: Network Switch Replacement Firewall Phone System Upgrade Uniterruptible Power Supply Servers Backups Wireless Access Points - Recreation Total 2020 | $60,000 | $4,500 | $10,000 - | $2,200 - | $60,000 2022 2021 - - - - - | $15,000 | $7,000 - | $5,000 | $32,000 | $8,000 - - - | $136,700 | $12,000 | $55,000 2023 - - - - - - - 2024 - - - | $7,000 - - - | $7,000 The network switch replacement was deferred during the 2019 budget deliberations. Staff believe that the current network switch hardware is at high risk of failure. Such a failure is very costly in terms of Staff productivity and community inconvenience. Such a failure could be particularly costly should it occur during a statutory deadline such as numerous legislated reporting deadlines, the property tax due date, or the days leading up to a Public Hearing. In 2016 and 2017 the current network switches failed and were not repaired for 72 hours. Staff estimate that these outages cost the District over | $60,000 in lost digital productivity during those timeframes. Switches are key components of IT networks, as they connect multiple computers, printers, access points, phone system, servers and other hardware. Financial Plan 2020 - 202480 FINANCIAL SERVICES CAPITAL PLAN The | $60,000 for wireless access points would ensure the wireless technology is installed in each of the recreation buildings. The hardware would enable wireless networks for both staff and patrons. Currently this amenity is available to patrons in many competing recreation centres. The current lack of available wifi has resulted in lost special bookings. Other costs in the IT hardware replacement capital budget includes regular maintenance and replacement of existing infrastructure. PC Hardware Replacement The Information Technology division deploys and maintains over 250 pieces of hardware for over 300 users. This inventory is valued at nearly | $200,000 and does not include printers or network hardware. Staff have established annual reserve contributions so that the financial impact of hardware replacement is not volatile. Budget Software (approved in 2019 – 2023 Financial Plan for 2019) This project was approved in the 2019 Financial Plan but has been deferred to 2021 due to work load prioritization. Staff currently use Excel spreadsheets to gather data and consolidate budget information. The process is onerous and also presents challenges for knowledge sharing and budget accountability. New software will centralize budget documentation, facilitate budget cooperation, input, and accountability. Software will fully integrate with the District’s current accounting software. Software will also support Staff efforts to prepare long-term Financial Plans.

The replacement cycle of these vehicles range from 6 to 10 years. The Department expects to replace four patrol vehicles between 2020 and 2023 and one administrative vehicle in 2024. The Department is reviewing options for deploying reduced emission vehicles. Total cost of the vehicles includes manufacturing and transportation as well as outfitting with equipment and branding. Police Computer Equipment Replacement Information Technology for the District’s police force is managed by the Saanich Police Department (SPD). SPD advises on an IT equipment replacement plan. Computer equipment expenditures are forecasted to be approximately | $290,000 over the next five years. Traffic Enforcement Equipment The police Department maintains a small annual budget to replace traffic enforcement equipment to meet the priority of Traffic Safety. Police Building Repairs The police Department operates out of an aging facility and plans for pending maintenance work and building enhancements to allow for safe and efficient use of space. There is a small structural change in the main office area planned for 2020 and future plans for work in the basement of the facility.

In 2017, Emery Electric conducted a survey of electrical power requirements for the Police and Fire Departments and found that the emergency generator units are at times over capacity and at risk of failure. A failure of either generator during a power outage would have significant impact on the operations of the Fire and Police Departments. The new generator would supply power for both Departments for an increased duration and higher degree of reliability. [References: Budget Estimates Committee, April 17, 2019] Engine with Light Rescue This capital project would replace the District’s 1990 Fire Engine (Engine) with a new NFPA and ULC compliant Engine. The primary standards that govern the design, maintenance, performance and replacement lifecycles for motorized fire apparatus are; ULC S515, NFPA 1901 and Canadian Fire Underwriters Survey. Under these standards, Engines and Quints are permitted to operate in a primary capacity for 15-years and a reserve capacity for 5-years. Thus a 20-year maximum service lifecycle is the industry standard Financial Plan 2020 - 202483 The 1990 Engine reached the end of its service lifecycle in February of 2010. This Engine is now 10-years past due for replacement. Consequently, no credit is being given towards the District’s current FUS Grading. When current procurement and build times within the fire apparatus industry are considered; it is projected that this Engine will not be physically replaced until late 2021. Delaying this purchase will negatively impact the Districts current FUS Grading. This will likely increase the financial cost of fire insurance for residents, businesses and institutions. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) PPE is the protective ensemble that firefighters wear while responding to fires, vehicle accidents, fire alarms and other calls. Arguably, PPE sees the most wear and tear of any safety equipment in use with Oak Bay firefighters. This Capital Project will allow the District to ensure the replacement of this critical safety equipment while managing safety and risk over the long term. Within the global firefighting industry, the occurrence of cancer within firefighters has become a significant occupational hazard. If the District is able to prevent a single presumptive firefighter cancer claim the savings are exponential. Such claims can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and can significantly impact WorkSafe premiums for years. Such an illness would have a severe impact on an individual, their family and the organization. PPE manufacturers are engineering new features into their garments that protect against carcinogens. By investing in these new protective features the District will be making significant strides towards managing this threat. The life-cycle costs have been integrated into the District’s equipment replacement plan and will be funded by annual reserve contributions. Fire Hall Interior Painting This project would result in painting of the apparatus bays, offices and corridors. The interior apparatus bays were last painted in 2004 and the offices and corridors have had a patchwork of painting and repairs occur since that time. Regular painting of areas projects a positive and professional image to our residents as we have several public tours and educational sessions held in the station throughout the year. Fire Hall Alerting & Display This capital project is for the purchase and installation of fire station alerting and display equipment to improve quality and efficiency of received dispatches. Our current dispatch provider is upgrading their dispatch service infrastructure to improve the quality of dispatches as well as the overall efficiency of the Dispatch Center. This upgrade to dispatch infrastructure creates an opportunity for Oak Bay to update local infrastructure to maintain compatibility, receive higher quality dispatches and improve crew turnout times to incidents. The upgrade will also expedite seamless dispatch of both Saanich and Oak Bay Fire Department apparatus on joint operations under Automatic and Mutual Aid agreements. Portable Apparatus Storage This capital budget funds the installation of a leased portable apparatus bay and the renovation of a 1963 era apparatus bay door. The initial capital funding will be used to prepare for and install the portable apparatus bay and improve an apparatus bay door. After the initial install and renovation, monthly lease payments will require ongoing funding. Leasing a portable apparatus storage bay will create space for a modern 100+Foot Quint that is designed to meet the needs of the community. Renovating a 1963 era apparatus bay door create space for a modern Engine that is designed to meet the needs of the community. Financial Plan 2020 - 202484 Conceptual Drawing Courtesy of Extreme Portable Buildings The dynamics of the legacy 1938/1962 OBFD fire station has created apparatus design issues for the past 30-years. Both the 1990 Engine and the 2002 Quint were designed to fit into the station rather than be optimized to serve the community. The fire station is well beyond its useful lifecycle however, replacement will take time. The addition of the portable apparatus bay and renovation of the door will buy the District time to plan for replacement. The lease options of the portable apparatus bay provides financial flexibility. Leasing also allows the District to allocate capital towards the renewal of the fire fleet which will ensure excellent service delivery. Leasing allows the District to consider the long term plan for the fire stations. The portable apparatus storage carries a number of lease buy out options. Emergency Program Vehicle Replacement The current Municipal Emergency Response Vehicle (MERV) is 30 years old and has far exceeded its life cycle. The current vehicle is not conducive to towing our three Emergency Program trailers and lacks standard safety enhancements. The purchase of a short box 4 wheel drive pickup truck will allow our Emergency Program Volunteers the ability to safely and effectively respond to calls for service regardless of road conditions and will allow the option of responding in a simple pickup truck or truck and trailer combination as required. Emergency Operations Centre Equipment & Training (Grant Funded) The Union of BC Municipalities has established a grant program called the Community Emergency Preparedness Fund. One of the grant steams available supports Emergency Operations Centres & Training. Staff are preparing a grant application but have yet to identify what specific training and equipment would be part of the application. Emergency Support Services Equipment (Grant Funded) The Union of BC Municipalities has established a grant program called the Community Emergency Preparedness Fund. One of the grant steams available supports Emergency Support services. Staff are preparing a grant application but have not yet determined the specific grant contents. C-Can Based Training Prop This is a capital project to install a new C-Can Based Training Prop (Prop) near the fire station. This plan also includes the re-design and integration of the 1967 era Training Tower (Tower). This new Prop would better simulate firefighting operations in the single-family, multi-family and commercial occupancies found in Oak Bay. Unfortunately, the Tower is unrealistic and provides limited training value. This dynamic is further complicated by the fact that access to realistic training locations within the District is becoming more restrictive. This location supports on-duty training which is important given current OBFD staffing models. In addition to being unrealistic, the Tower is starting to show its age. It was built in 1967 and has never seen any significant upgrades. Repairs for corrosion and structural concerns were completed in 1987 and 2007. Integration of the Tower into a new Prop would bring this piece of Oak Bay firefighting history back to life. Financial Plan 2020 - 202485 Under WorkSafe BC and the OFC Playbook; the District has a moral and legal obligation to train its firefighters to NFPA standards. Furthermore, a commitment to training has always been part of the OBFD’s culture. Creating this new training space, with a combination of legacy and new materials supports this culture. It will ensure that Oak Bay firefighters secure a safe, realistic and adaptable training location for the long-term. Ladder Truck with Heavy Rescue Capabilities This capital budget would fund the replacement of the 2002 68 foot Quint with a new modern NFPA and ULC compliant 100+Foot Quint in 2020. The primary standards that govern the design, maintenance/ performance and replacement lifecycles for Engines are ULC S515, NFPA 1901 and Canadian Fire Underwriters Survey. Under these standards, Quints are permitted to operate in a primary capacity for 15-years and a reserve capacity for an additional 5-years. Maximum service lifecycle is 20-years. Provided that prescribed preventative maintenance and performance testing is successfully performed/documented throughout the life of the apparatus. The 2002 Quint will reach end of its service lifecycle in July of 2022. This 2002 Quint is the only Aerial Device serving Oak Bay. Due to the age of the 1990 Engine the Quint is also the only backup Engine serving Oak Bay. When current procurement and build times within the fire apparats market are considered, it is likely that this Quint will not physically be replaced until early to mid 2022. Delaying this purchase beyond the 2020 budget year could negatively impact the current Fire Insurance Grading. This is likely to increase the financial cost of fire insurance for residents, businesses and institutions within the District. The OBFD fleet has not been expanded since 1962. Due to its small size, it simply lacks the capacity to compensate for an Engine or Quint that is reaching the end of its service lifecycle. Larger fire Departments have additional capacity within their fleets to negate this type of compression. The lean nature of the Oak Bay Fire Department makes it critical that FUS replacement schedules are judiciously maintained. Compliance with these standards will manage fire insurance costs and protect the community from undue risk and liability associated with operating expired fire equipment. This purchase would result in the current 68-foot aerial ladder truck being replaced with a 100-foot ladder truck. The current 2002 Quint had to be built with a 75-foot Aerial Device in order to accommodate fire station limitations. When the 2002 Quint arrived, it did not fit length-wise into the apparatus bay. Unfortunately the solution was to physically cut-down the Aerial Device to make it fit. The result was a reduced Aerial Device with total length of 68-feet. The net change from 85-feet to 68-feet represented a 20% reduction in the overall reach. The current condition of the fire fleet is such that investment in a new Engine and a new 100+Foot Quint that meet community needs is critical. In order to accommodate the 100+Foot Quint, new apparatus storage is required. The new apparatus storage add approximately 17.5% in life-cycle costs but the quint will have an additional 47% servicing potential. The 100ft ladder will also assist the District in maintaining strong relationships with the other core-three municipalities: Victoria, Saanich, and Esquimalt. Financial Plan 2020 - 202486 Photo Courtesy of Spartan Fire Apparatus Example of Ladder Truck with Heavy Rescue Capailities Thermal Imaging Protective Equipment Thermal Imaging Cameras (TICs) are a significant expenditure and Staff have integrated the equipment into the reserve-funded replacement program. TIC’s provide firefighters the gift of sight in dark and smoky conditions. They are arguably the single most important advancement in the global firefighting industry in the past 20-years. TIC’s expedite search and rescue as well as fire attack when seconds count. This Capital Project will allow the OBFD to ensure the replacement of this critical safety equipment and manage health and safety over the long term. Over the past 20 years the use of light weight synthetic composites in building construction materials and furnishings has created a fire environment that is extremely challenging. Fires in 2020 do not ‘burn hotter’ than they did in the past. Modern fires reach peak temperatures much more rapidly and quickly generate extremely dark toxic smoke conditions while they expedite structural collapse. TIC’s allow firefighters to work efficiently in these extremely dark toxic smoke conditions. TIC technology is constantly advancing and replacement should occur every 5-years. By reinvesting in state of the art TIC’s the District will be making significant strides towards meeting this evolving threat and optimizing firefighter effectiveness. Technical Rescue Protective Equipment The two primary standards that govern the use, care and replacement of Technical Rescue Equipment (TRE) are NFPA 1983 and WorkSafe BC Part 32. These standards require that all ‘soft-goods’ be replaced after 5-years of active service. They also require replacement if TRE is physically damaged or contaminated with chemical and biological substances. Soft-goods comprises all harnesses, ropes, webbing and anchor straps. Hardware represents carabiners, pulleys, belay devices, tripods, stretchers and all the supporting safety equipment. TRE replacement has been integrated into the fire equipment replacement plan and funded by annual reserve contributions. Pickup Truck This Capital budget will fund the replacement of the 2008 Toyota Camry Sedan (Camry) in 2022 with a new Hybrid or true Electric 4x4 Pick-Up Truck (Pick-Up). The change from a Camry to a Pick-Up is intended to provide the fire Department with an appropriate tool for the job. The Camry currently serves as a logistics and on-call duty officer vehicle. The Camry is a medium sized 4-door sedan style passenger car and it is not well suited for use in the fire service. The Camry does not have an NFPA 1901 compliant lights and sirens safety package. A new Pick-Up would be NFPA 1901 compliant, have added safety features and be much more useful. In addition to the fact that the Camry is not suited for the role that it currently fills, it is starting to show its age. Financial Plan 2020 - 202487 The vehicle is a hybrid but, it is first generation technology and significant repairs to the battery system are looming. By the time of replacement, the Camry will be 15 years old and it will have an estimated 150,000 to 160,000 kilometers. The lack of an NFPA 1901 compliant lights and sirens package restricts it to non-emergency use. A new Pick-Up will provide a vehicle that is much safer, more effective, able to function post-disaster and contribute towards the Districts environmental stewardship. OBFD staff are currently researching replacement options and anticipate that a true Electric Pick-Up will be available by 2022. Gas Detective Protective Equipment Gas Detectors are one of the most effective tools for protecting first responders from unseen and unknown atmospheric hazards. They provide a means of early detection and allow firefighters to take precautionary steps to protect themselves and the citizens they serve. This Capital Project will allow the fire Department to ensure the replacement of this critical safety equipment and manage health and safety over the long term. There is a continual need to actively manage Gas Detectors in order to protect the health and safety of firefighters. Wear and tear on the internal electronic components of Gas Detectors at incidents and during training are major stressors. The electrochemical sensors within Gas Detectors are always ‘working’ as they are constantly exposed to the atmosphere. These factors are compounded when continual advancements in technology render legacy Gas Detectors obsolete. After five 5-years of service replacement is warranted in order to ensure reliability and optimum performance. By reinvesting in Gas Detectors the District will be making significant strides towards maintaining this critical safety equipment. The life-cycle costs have been integrated into the District’s equipment replacement plan and will be funded by annual reserve contributions. Vehicle-Extrication Protective Equipment Vehicle extrication equipment is a significant expenditure and Staff have integrated the equipment into the reserve-funded replacement program. The automotive industry is constantly working to reduce weight and improve the strength of vehicle structural components. The introduction of High Strength Low Alloy Steel and Hydro-Formed Parts has yielded significant advancements. Jaws of Life can now become obsolete in as little as 5-years. Scheduled replacement is required in order to ensure these challenges are met. This Capital Project will allow the District to ensure the replacement of this critical safety equipment over the long term.

This capital project will add work stations for the Foremen/Lead Hands in Public Works including two new workstations, and modernization of existing workstations. Currently, work-order management and maintenance management is conducted using traditional paper based methods. These paper based records are then integrated into the computer-based management system, creating an unnecessary duplication of work. Transportation Safety Improvements This program aims to increase the funding commitment towards transportation safety projects, including crosswalks, traffic calming, intersection improvements and other safety related capital works. The funding currently allocated for transportation safety projects is limited. That typically means only one crosswalk upgrade (or small traffic calming project) per year, approximately 7 new curb drops, and one intersection upgrade per year. Financial Plan 2020 - 202489 Traffic Calming (carry-over) The Traffic Calming budget falls within the broader Council Strategic objective of Transportation Safety Improvements. The projects that are typically done in this area include cross walk upgrades, chicanes, intersection improvements, or other methods to influence vehicle driver behavior to make the transportation network safer for pedestrians and multi-modal users. Pavement Management Program The road surface rehabilitation program, known in Oak Bay as Pavement Management, has been ongoing for several years. The aim is to develop a sustainable management program that achieved a specific service level while maintaining best value for money. The District’s Pavement Management Study, completed in 2013, identified over | $2M of road rehabilitation would need to occur each year in order to maintain the pavement condition identified in that year. Street Light Replacement (carry-over) Complete the final phase of the District’s street light upgrade project, converting street lights to LED and cutting electricity costs by up to 2/3rds. Inflow & Infiltration Lining (carry-over) As part of the District’s storm drain rehabilitation work, these inflow and infiltration projects are specific storm main rehabilitation projects that are completed using trenchless technologies such as cured-in-place- pipe lining. These trenchless techniques can extend the life span of an existing main by 50-70 years via a less disruptive and less expensive construction method. Storm Sewer Rehabilitation This program captures the refurbishment or replacement of Storm Sewer Mains that have reached end of service life. Based on asset management program targets, the program gradually increases capital expenditures for Storm Sewer Rehabilitation to | $1.1M per year. The program has been underfunded in recent years: the 2016 budget was | $212,000, the 2017 budget was | $117,000 (funded from reserves) and the 2018 budget was | $265,000. Consistent and predictable funding for Storm Sewer Rehabilitation is essential to ensure that capital projects are done efficiently and with best value for money. This funding commitment allows a more cost effective planned approach to repairs and rehabilitation, as opposed Uplands Sewer Separation (Partially Grant Funded) The Uplands neighbourhood currently has a single sewer system that accommodates both sanitary sewage and stormwater flows. During heavy rainfall, the storm water volume exceeds the capacity of the system and a combination of stormwater and raw sewage discharges into the shallows ocean waters at the Rutland Road and Humber Road pump stations. Separating combined sewers and eliminating overflows at the Humber and Rutland pump stations is necessary under British Columbia’s Municipal Wastewater Regulation. In October 2016, the District of Oak Bay’s Council committed to a plan to separate combined sewers in the Uplands. The plan involves constructing approximately 5km of new storm mains, progressively diverting stormwater flows from homes and from catch basins to the new storm sewers. This plan has the added benefit of reducing the volume of stormwater in the sanitary sewer system, enabling the District to take positive steps towards meeting its sewer flow commitments under the Core Area Liquid Waste Management Plan.

The metal railings used for pedestrian safety in those areas are exposed to elements, particularly the salt water spray. This results in accelerated corrosion and failure of the railings. As part of an ongoing safety program, the District conducts periodic railings maintenance to refurbish or replace these railings. Active Transportation Program This new Capital Program represents the beginning of an active transportation program focusing on issues such as bicycle lanes, pathways, and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure improvements. Electric Vehicle Stations At the January 30, 2020 Special Meeting of Council, Council asked staff to include and initiative in the 2020 – 2024 financial plan to install electric vehicle charging stations. Staff have integrated | $15,000 into the special initiatives budget for the development of an options analysis report as well as | $50,000 in the capital budget. The operating budget has also been increased by | $12,500 starting in 2022 representing incremental operating costs and infrastructure replacement reserve contributions.

District staff refurbish, replace or install new manholes on a regular basis to ensure the sanitary sewer system can be maintained and operated effectively. Sewer Main Rehabilitation As part of the sanitary sewer asset management, Engineering Services replaces or refurbishes portions of the approximately 100 km of sanitary sewer mains that service the District. These main replacements are typically done as conventional excavations or, if possible, via less disruptive and less expensive trenchless rehabilitation such as cured-in-place-pipe lining. The aim of this work is to install a new pipe or extend the life span of an existing pipe for another 50-70 years. New Service Connections As residents request new service lateral connections for their homes to the sanitary sewer system, Engineering and Public Works staff work together to estimate, plan, construct and close out these mini-projects. Though these service connections are completed on cost-recovery basis, this budget line item provides the funding for planning purposes related to parts and services in preparation for this work.

In 2022 this project involves replacement of the cardio equipment at the Oak Bay Recreation Centre and Henderson Recreation Centre. This is done every three years. The dollar value represents the down payment, with the balance being funded via loan. 4. Henderson Building Maintenance In 2021 this includes three smaller projects: refinishing the gymnasium wood floor, removing an old, large hot water tank and replacing washroom stalls and vanities. These are all normal building maintenance issues that need to be addressed to keep the building looking good and functioning well. In 2022 this project involves replacement of an on demand hot water heater for hot water in the building. The current unit was installed in 2012. 5. Henderson Gymnasium Roof Replacement This project involves replacement of the roof over the gymnasium at the Henderson Recreation Centre. 6. Henderson Equipment This project involves replacement of the Bouncy Castle at Henderson Recreation Centre. This is a popular piece of equipment that sees a lot of use. These apparatus are typically replaced every three years to ensure reliability. 7. Monterey Building Maintenance In 2021 this project includes two smaller projects: renovating washrooms and replacing the steamer in the kitchen. These are all normal building maintenance issues. In 2023 this project involves replacement of the linoleum in the kitchen and the hallway in the east wing of the Monterey Centre. 8. OBRC Transformer Replacement The main electrical service to the Oak Bay Recreation Centre was installed in 1973. The life expectancy of the equipment is 30-40 years, and it has now been in service for nearly 47 years. The existing installation, while grandfathered, does not meet current electrical codes and replacement parts are no longer available. The District currently owns this equipment. Replacement of the equipment would ensure we are compliant with current electrical codes, and ownership of the transformer would transfer to BC Hydro (meaning BC Hydro would be responsible for maintenance and replacement in the future). In addition, phase protection against single phase disruptions would be installed, protecting expensive equipment that can often require replacement after such events. 9. OBRC Pool Roof This project involves the replacement of the pool roof at the Oak Bay Recreation Centre, as recommended in a roofing audit conducted on Recreation Centres in 2013 Financial Plan 2020 - 2024 97 10. OBRC Parking Lot Paving This project involves re-paving the main parking lot (upper and lower). The current condition of the parking lot is such that waiting much longer will potentially require a significantly more costly renovation. 11. OBRC Desert Air Replacement This project involves replacement of the dehumidification unit in the pool. The unit has been requiring costly repairs on a more regular basis. When the unit is not functioning well the air quality in the pool suffers, leading to patron complaints, employee health concerns and potential long-term damage to the building structure. 12. OBRC Arena, Lounge, & ISF Roof Replacement at OBRC This project involves replacement of the roof over the arena, Indoor Sports Field and Sports View Lounge. This project can be phased if required 13. OBRC Chiller Replacement This project involves replacement of the chiller, which is a significant piece of the refrigeration infrastructure in the arena. The chiller is at the end of its expected lifespan, and needs to be replaced during an Arena shutdown year. A failed chiller was the root cause of the incident in Fernie, BC which claimed three lives. 14. OBRC Equipment This project includes replacement of an air handling unit and an ice edger. 15. OBRC Building General In 2023 this includes replacement of the pool chemical control system and filters for the learn pool and a door replacement in 2024. 16. OBRC Ice Resurfacer Replacement This project involves replacement of the current electric Zamboni. 17. Carnarvon Park Pickleball Court Patching The outdoor courts at Carnarvon Park are showing signs of cracking and depressions in the surface. If left unaddressed they will pose a safety concern. It is expected these courts will be used for several years before the Carnarvon Park Master Plan recommendations are fully implemented. The funding for this project is being carried over from 2019 because contractor availability and the weather made it not possible to complete in 2019. 18. Andersen Hill Park Kiosk The current information kiosk at Anderson Hill Park is rapidly deteriorating and contains outdated information. A new kiosk would help to support the efforts of an active volunteer group who work to remove invasive species from the park and to maintain the endangered Garry Oak ecosystem. The panels would be included which explain the park’s history and note species of plants and wildlife found in the park. 19. Lafayette Park Irrigation This project involves installation of digital controls to the irrigation system, as has been done in other major park spaces in the past few years. This provides for efficient use of staff time. 20. Windsor Playground This project involves replacement of the playground equipment at Windsor Park in the same location, using the same footprint. 21. Parks Tree Inventory Software This project involves purchase of software to collect and maintain data for trees in the community. This is a Financial Plan 2020 - 202498 recommendation of the Urban Forest Management Strategy and is noted in the 2018-2022 Implementation Plan approved by Council. 22. Henderson Park Playground Equipment This project involves replacement of the playground equipment at Henderson Park in the same location, using the same footprint. 23. Carnarvon Park Design This project involves detailed design and production of a construction drawing package for all elements in included in the Carnarvon Park Master Plan (save for the building, which is being addressed separately). 24. Carnarvon Building Construction This project involves demolition of the old building and construction of a new two-storey building, as recommended in the Carnarvon Park Master Plan. 25. Parks Deep Tine Aerator This project involves purchase of a deep tine aerator/verti-cutter to maintain sports fields in good condition. Currently the District borrows an old piece of equipment from the District of Saanich, but it is becoming costly to maintain. 26. Lafayette Park Playground Equipment This project involves replacement of the playground equipment at Lafayette Park in the same location, using the same footprint. 27. Sports View Lounge Equipment This project includes two smaller projects: replacement of table tops in the Lounge, and replacement of the bar fridge. Both projects are considered normal building maintenance issues. In 2023 this project involves replacement of the ice machine in the Sports View Lounge. 28. Windsor Park Tennis Court Resurfacing This project involves crack repair and resurfacing of three tennis courts at Windsor Park. This work is required to maintain the courts in a safe, playable condition. 29. Tennis Bubbles Court Resurfacing This project involves crack repair and resurfacing of courts in both bubbles at OBRC. This work is required to maintain the courts in a safe, playable condition. 30. Public Art The District of Oak Bay, through its Public Arts Advisory Committee and its Arts Laureate operates an annual public art program, called “ArtsAlive,” whereby artists are invited to submit art to be juried for display in the community for a period of one year. The general public is given the opportunity to vote for their favourite art work. The People’s Choice Award goes to the art work receiving the most public votes. As per the Public Arts Policy, the District contributes | $20,000 annually to the Public Art Fund which supports the opportunity to purchase the People’s Choice Award winning art for permanent installation upon recommendations by the Public Arts Advisory Committee and approval by Council. The ArtsAlive program has been in operation since 2014. Financial Plan 2020 - 202499 OPERATING IMPACT OF NEW CAPITAL SERVICES Capital Cost* As the District acquires and constructs new capital, often annual incremental maintenance costs are incurred. The District will also be expected to replace the infrastructure at the end of its useful life. As a result, the District should consider these costs (referred to as “life-cycle costs”) when purchasing or acquiring capital.

Financial Plan 2020 - 2024110 APPENDIX C: BASIS OF ACCOUNTING AND BUDGETING The accounting policies of the District conform to Canadian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles for local governments and the Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared as prescribed by the Public Sector Ac- counting Board (PSAB) of the Canadian Institute of Chartered Professional Accountants. The District uses var- ious funds to account for its revenues and expenditures. The revenue in each fund may be spent only for the purpose specified in the fund. Each fund belongs to one of five categories: general, parks & recreation, sewer, water, or reserve. General funds are used for general government and protective services. Recreational funds are used for day to day operating of the District’s Parks, Recreation and Culture Department. Water and Sewer funds are self-financed utilizes, except for a general fund contribution to the sewer fund. Both utility funds are used for operating and capital purposes. Reserve funds accumulate revenue and interest that will be used to pay for major capital expenses in future years. All funds (general, sewer utility and reserves) are accounted for on the accrual basis. Sources of revenue are recognized when earned. Revenue unearned in the current period is reported on the balance sheet as deferred revenue.

Funding Sources Property Value Tax Distribution Permissive Tax Exemptions 1. Funding Sources (a) Revenue from Property Value Taxes Objectives and Policies Approximately 95% of the District’s tax base is in the residential class. The high percentage of Residential value, which by its nature is spread over a very large number of properties as opposed to being concentrated in a single industry or sector, enhances the dependability of the property tax as a revenue source. The higher the proportion of total revenue attributable to the property tax, the more predictable are actual revenues for the year and the lower is the likelihood of a shortfall relative to the budgeted revenue amount. On the other hand, user fees provide individuals with consumption choice. The amount of the value-based tax levy for a parcel of land is something over which the owner has virtually no control. The objective of Council with respect to the property tax, therefore, is to achieve a balance between the revenue predictability, and the goal of restraining the growth of the property value-based tax burden on the other. Council policy is to use the property tax levy to balance the expenditure side of the budget for each year after examining the potential for sustainable revenues from all other sources. (b) Revenue From Parcel Taxes Objectives and Policies A parcel tax is a tax levy on land, the amount of which is not a function of the assessed value of the land. It can be the same amount for every parcel regardless of size, or it can vary with the area or frontage of a parcel. Only in limited circumstances is a parcel tax an alternative to a property value-based tax. It can only be applied to properties receiving a particular service and cannot be used for the funding of general services. With the property tax taking into account the value of improvements as well as land, there is a higher probability, compared to a parcel tax, that it will be related to ability to pay. The objective of Council with regard to the parcel tax concept is to ensure that its use is fair in light of the actual distribution of the benefits conferred by the service that it is intended to fund. Council policy to date has been to use the parcel tax only to cover part of the cost of maintaining boulevards on a limited number of streets where this service is provided by the Municipality. With the value of the service directly related to the amount of boulevard to be maintained, the parcel tax in this case is based on frontage. Financial Plan 2020 - 2024121 (c) Revenue From Fees Fees charged for specific services form a large part of the municipal revenue stream, adding approximately another 50% to the amount raised by the property value-based tax levy. The largest component of user fee revenue is generated from the Municipality’s recreation programs. The objective of Council is to ensure that recreation user fee revenues cover all the direct program costs, and to maximize the coverage of fixed overhead costs as well. Council policy in this regard is to review recreation user fees not less than annually, against the backdrop of the regional market. Smaller than recreation fee revenue, is the solid waste collection and disposal charge, which is a fixed amount for each collection unit (e.g., a dwelling unit or small business) served by municipal crews. The principal objective with respect to the use of a solid waste charge rather than the property value-based tax is to avoid double charging properties which, due to volume and the nature of the equipment used, must contract privately for solid waste collection services. Council policy is to recover 100% of its solid waste disposal and collection costs through the solid waste fee. The Municipality also operates a water distribution system. Its fiscal objective with respect to the system is to cover the associated costs on a user-pay basis, and the policy in this regard is to set water consumption rates and connection fees at a level which achieves this goal without any requirement for subsidization from the property value-based tax. The Municipality’s sewer system is also operated as a utility, which has traditionally been funded through the property value-based tax, with minor contributions from connection fees. With large capital costs forthcoming in order to comply with the Capital Regional District’s Core Area Liquid Waste Management plan along with the Provincial Municipal Sewage Regulation, however, Council has set an objective of funding a greater portion of sewer utility costs from user fees. With household water consumption closely tied to capacity requirements in the sewer system, Council has by policy determined to raise 70% of its sewer utility costs from a water consumption-based user fee. (d) Revenue From Other Sources Revenue in the “Other Sources” class consists primarily 1% utility revenue and grant in lieu of taxes. The principal objective with respect to the use of these revenues to complement property taxation for funding of municipal services. (e) Proceeds From Borrowing The objective of Council is to maintain its long-term debt servicing costs at a manageable level by replacing infrastructure on an incremental “pay as you go” basis. Council policy is to limit the creation of long-term debt to the financing of large capital projects which cannot efficiently be undertaken on an incremental basis, or where such an approach would not be adequate to meet requirements with respect to public safety, health or senior government regulations. Financial Plan 2020 - 2024122 The objective for short term borrowing (less than 5 years) is to maintain the outstanding debt at a relatively constant level so that with the amortization of the debt on a project so financed, further investments in the assets of the Municipality can be made without tax impact. The amount of short term debt which can be outstanding at any one time is relatively low pursuant to the requirements of the Community Charter, hence projects funded in this manner tend to be relatively small; alternatively, the short term debt may represent only part of the overall funding package. 2. Property Value Tax Distribution With non-residential properties representing a very small proportion of the total tax base, taxing other classes at a high multiple of the residential rate would be of relatively small benefit to the homeowner, while imposing a larger burden on business property owners and their commercial tenants. The municipal business tax rate as a multiple of the residential tax rate, therefore, is very low relative to most local governments throughout British Columbia. There is no property in the Industry class, and only a small amount in the Recreation class. The objective of Council is to distribute future property value tax increases equitably among the three main classes of property within the Municipality after Non Market Change has been considered. The policy is to adjust the tax rate ratios each year so that the increase on the average individual property is approximately the same for each of the main classes after Non Market Change has been considered. There is one property in the Farm class. The value of the property, however, is in its residential use, and the policy is to set the Farm tax rate so as to produce for that one property a municipal tax levy comparable to what it would have been had it remained in the Residential class and increased in assessed value at a rate comparable to other residential properties in its immediate neighbourhood. 3. Permissive Exemption Tax The objective being to distribute the tax burden fairly among properties receiving municipal services, Council makes very little use of its authority to grant permissive tax exemptions. The policy to date has been to grant permissive exemptions only for land and improvements appurtenant to property already exempted by statute (e.g., churches), portions of municipal land leased or licensed to a non- profit organization providing a service complementary to municipal services, and in one case, an institution of childhood learning not statutorily exempt.

For instance, revenue is recognized in the financial statements when earned, not when received. Accumulated Surplus: The accumulated surplus is a pool of accumulated funds resulting from all historical budgetary surpluses. Budgetary surpluses result in funds remaining in accumulated surplus (unappropriated) or transferred to reserve (appropriated). Appropriated: When a fund is appropriated, it is subject to certain restrictions on what the fund can be used for.

Capital Expenditure: The expenditure of monies for the purchase or construction of a capital asset. Deferred Revenue: Refers to payments received in advance for services which have not yet been performed. The most common form of deferred revenue in municipal accounting consists of Development Cost Charges which are advanced payments for future capital services needed as a result of growth. Financial Plan: This term is used interchangeably with “budget” but will also usually refer to the 5-year budget bylaw. Forced growth: Increased costs that the District must incur to continue to provide existing services at the same service level. For instance, collective agreement increases, inflation and contractual increases are forced growth factors. Forced growth is not increases to service delivery costs resulting from elective changes or enhancements to existing programs. Fund: A pool of money set aside for a specific purpose. FTE (Full Time Equivalent): A statistic to compare staffing levels between Departments, Financial Plan 2020 - 2024126 organizations, or years.

LGDE (Local Government Data Entry): Life-Cycle Costs: Full life-cycle costs refer to the total costs incurred by a piece of capital during the entirety of its useful life. For instance, the full life-cycle costs would include the acquisition or construction cost, maintenances costs, and the cost of ongoing annual repairs and maintenance for continued provision of the capital service. Liability: Municipal Finance Authority (MFA): The Municipal Finance Authority of British Columbia (MFA) was created in 1970 to contribute to the financial well-being of local governments throughout BC.

The MFA is independent from the Province of British Columbia and operates under the governance of a Board of Members appointed from the various Regional Districts within the province. New Construction Taxation Revenue: Taxation revenue that results from taxable land or buildings that were not subject to taxes in the previous year.

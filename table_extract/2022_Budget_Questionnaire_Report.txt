change mitigation policies, and regulatory frameworks in almost all areas. I am acutely aware that there was and still is a massive hole to get out of with regard to all 3 of these, but please get on with it! Enough pandering to the establishment who want Oak Bay to remain stuck in the 1950s. An annual collection of large, inorganic trash items would be good. We need to always be diligent on reducing regulation and burdensome red tape merely because it has “always been there” or in response to a complaint from a vocal individual. Our housing issues (lack of reasonably priced ownership and rental) is in large part caused by this. NIMBY is alive and well in Oak Bay, and our reputation as grumpy old people needs to be actively addressed. There is no real space to ask for (much needed) improvements in active transportation in general — wider, better maintained sidewalks & crosswalks for pedestrians, as well as better cycling infrastructure, more street patio permits, and a general move away from car culture. Oak Bay is far behind other municipalities in these areas... & needs to catch up by investing in infrastructure and improvements there. I am concerned with the increased ongoing cost of new administrative staff. I am aware that the municipality population has not grown much over the last 5 years and service levels that I consume have remained the same. I strongly suggest that some administrative roles be made part time or combined for major salary and benefit savings. If the suite proposal(s) are implemented the salary savings may be needed for enforcement of the suite bylaws. Overall, I am satisfied with current municipal services and understand that there is a need to set aside substantial funds for infrastructure replacement. I am ok with that and hope that funding can be coordinated with the actual contract work.

Aim for specific bike routes with no cars parking allowed or decrease space for cars - etc. one way streets or cancel turning lanes. Developers should be asked to contribute when big builds - why didn't that happen at Bowker? Estevan/Musgrave intersection doesn't work with 2 way stops as it is a 5 way and traffic goes too fast and drivers do not realize it is 2 way and not 4 way. Many school children on this route Please do something to calm the flow of traffic around our Schools. There are far too many people who speed past Willows School in particular. There needs to be much more visible signage and flashing lights near Willows School on Dalhousie St, Musgrave Street and Cadboro Bay Road. Willows Beach desperately needs a new playground. re. the question "Manage removal and replacement of trees" -- I answered "increase" based on what I thought you meant. I favour strict control of tree removal - since I think that the mature trees should be considered a community asset and not a personal possession, to be removed easily to accommodate personal desires on a property. No no. The tree was probably there when you purchased - don't like trees, don't purchase a treed property. They are irreplaceable. Boulevard trees do not stand in for those big guys, and they drop of themselves due to age etc. There has to be more control and consciousness -raising. Victoria seems to have declared war on trees. Thanks! I would like to see better speed and vehicle noise control along Cadboro Bay Road by police. This problem seems to be ever increasing - couldn't the speed limit be lowered consistently to 30 km/h? Space for dogs to be safely off-leash year-round is of crucial importance to Oak Bay. The lack of a safe space to exercise leads to worse dog behaviour, means residents have to drive elsewhere to exercise their dogs (if they are able) - and not an insignificant number of people simply off-leash their dog where it isn't allowed, which is understandable but not ideal for anyone. At a minimum, one fully-fenced, decently sized dog park in the municipality and another year-round, full-time off-leash area are necessary. (And that would be a very meager service level for how many dog- District of Oak Bay Budget Questionnaire 2022 : Survey Report for 4 October 2021 to 24 October 2021 owning households live here!) Very many residents have dogs in their households and animal welfare requires they have space to fulfil their physical and social needs. Dogs & their owners are a part of our community. * I would be greatly in favour of a large extension of Oak Bay's dedicated cycling infrastructure. For health, for the climate, for the livability of our municipality - this is hugely important. Oak Bay is blessed with many quiet side streets but the cycling provision on major commuter routes (Foul Bay, Cadboro Bay, etc) are deeply lacking and unsafe. * Oak Bay is in dire economic straits with its budget deficits. This problem was created in the past but it will have to be resolved by us, now. The very best way to do this is to increase density. To maintain the same level of amenities, our options are to increase taxes dramatically, or to increase taxpayers - one of those things is untenable if we want any but the megarich to live here. The other will welcome more families into our community. It seems to me the second is the best way to ensure that we can continue maintaining the district at its current level. If Oak Bay doesn't adapt, it will slowly die. For the love of this area, we need to adjust. I would strongly support measures to meaningfully increase density in Oak Bay and welcome more neighbors to strengthen our community. Cats should be licenced and not allowed outside of the owners property off leash. I am tired of cat scat and dead birds in my yard. Illegal suites are out of control, we need regulation. Audit the efficacy of the Police, Fire and Municipal outcall services in Oak Bay. It is apparent from this questionnaire itself, that the respective efficiency and value for money services, are treated as a given. But it is not, and should never be. There is a surely a relationship with cost and consumer of these services satisfaction, that is not being addressed, in these questions. Reliance on metrics, or number of outcalls and/or costs incurred are not necessarily the only measure of performance standards as equivilent to expected value, based on those metrics. An objective, disinterested third party (in 5 year cycles), evaluation is called for and well overdue. I really appreciate the work the District does and I feel like the District delivers good value for the tax money. I trust the District to use additional tax money well. Climate change, municipal infrastructure, and cycling / walking /public transit infrastructure are the most important things to me. I would like to be allowed to build a small carriage home on home RS1 lot.

Q5 (and it applies to Q4 as well). Unless one is knowledgeable about current asset health and replacement cost it really is difficult to respond. Amount proposed for collection seem to far exceed the actual amount of deferred maintenance. Option 1 (i.e. high taxes upfront and one time may be best as we would be buying supplies at today's dollar value/cost but then we won't be able to replace all in that same year presumably so what if codes or technology change by the time we are in year 5? Inventory is obsolete or maybe we had to incurr storage cost? Again, can't respond. For such significant and essential costs/service maybe another survey with pros and cons of each option for Q4 and 5 is a better engagement strategy. Ps: well done on GHG reduction. Thank you. In the past few winters we have had some week-long snow and ice events. I would like to see more enforcement/communication to clear sidewalks and drains.

There is no reason why electric car users should have power provided at no cost, just as owners of gas powered cars do not. Too much has been spent both in Oak and the CRD on biking infrastructure without paying any attention to the crumbling roads we have around the region - there is too much emphasis on the needs of a smaller group and not enough in enhancing all forms of transportation The arterial roads within Oak Bay require reconstruction. For example Lansdowne Road east of Cadboro Bay Road which is subject to a large volume of construction traffic for which it was not constructed to accommodate. The result being a broken surface unsafe for cyclists. I have witnessed more than one bike accident on this section of road.

There is a desperate need in the municipality for dog-free outdoor recreation space, and the enforcement of same. Currently the Jack Wallace Memorial track and the Henderson Chip trail regulations disallowing dogs are not being followed or enforced, and virtually every other park in the municipality allows off-leash dogs. Canarvon Park, nominally on-leash, is over run by off leash dogs. Both Uplands Park and Anderson Hill are being destroyed by their use as dog parks; both to protect these areas and to allow everyone to use them, banning dogs in these parks should be an immediate priority. No comments Like other OB opinion surveys, this one pretty dumb. Questions 4, 5 and 6 don't make any sense. Look at the numbers. Does no one proofread this stuff before it goes live? Question 7 is inane without specification of what infrastructure is involved. Obviously we need working sewers and water supply, etc., and some upgrade to public facilities such as the Esplanade walkway and possible extension thereof seems desirable to this respondent. But asking for carte blanche approval of overall changes in capital expenditure, suggests considerable contempt for the judgement, intelligence and interests of the public. Q14, here as elsewhere, the question bundles a whole lot of issues about which opinions will differ, thereby giving council freedom to do what it wants without any genuine evidence of public support Overall, a typically nonsensical OB survey that treats taxypayers with the degree of contempt that one would expect only from more senior levels of government. Bike lanes are not needed in oak bay. Cyclists can share the road with motorists, possibly learn to be more vehicle aware. Helmets, lights and reflective clothing should be a necessity,vehicles have mandated safety features, why not cyclists. Bike lanes are unnecessary and should be removed. Electric charging is the responsibiity of the car owner or available at District of Oak Bay Budget Questionnaire 2022 : Survey Report for 4 October 2021 to 24 October 2021 commercial facilities - it is not municipal governments role as they do not provide gas stations.

I would also like to see more bike lanes and better connections to the bike lanes established by the City of Victoria (such as a traffic light at Haultain and Oak Bay so that cyclists do not have to dismount and use crosswalk). I think that residents would also benefit from wider sidewalks, especially along Oak Bay Avenue (all the way from the village to Foul Bay Road). Thank you. Would like to see decrease in use and noise level of gas powered leaf blowers. Would also like to see more planting of young oak trees as we are loosing so many of our lovely old trees. Also would like to reduce number of deer as impact my garden and feeling of safety when out walking. There is a critical need to improve roads .There are dangerous dips on Eastdowne & areas where water accumulates. It is sufficiently poor that some of these areas require that you steer around them.

My husband who was born and raised here says his childhood was spent at the outdoor pools. Beacon hill park would also be a great place for one (not in oak bay). Lived here a decade and all attention is always on the richer areas of oak bay. Half the time I can’t park in front of my own home and nothing gets done for those in the “cheap seats”. Great to have pricey art but maybe a playground upgrade? Especially at willows. We bike to and from work downtown and we have kids that bike to school. We need added safe bike routes. Look to Vancouver for ideas. We also do not have enough green space and parks here and would desperately like to see an increase. Safe cycling from ob to Victoria Walking infrastructure like wider sidewalks is also great to have if possible. It’s so great to be able to walk all around oak bay for daily errands and needs.

Consider supporting hydrolands park in building a dedicated off leash space. All other areas should be no dogs, or leash only depending on environmental impact and foot traffic. Way more bike lanes! The amount of cycling infrastructure in oak bay is pathetic. Cycling is good for the environment and for local businesses, it should be encouraged as much as possible and infrastructure (not paint on the road, actual physical infrastructure) is the best way to accomplish that. Most people's reason for not cycling is safety, build it well and they will come! 1. The district must have a financial plan that includes borrowing for capital assets so that infrastructure— sewers, drainage, roads, sidewalks— are brought up to 21st Century standards within the next 5 years. We cannot address the impacts (foreseen & unforseen) of climate change with 100 year old infrastructure. It is NORMAL to borrow for such projects. Further, there is federal | $available to municipalities for such work. We need to access that now. 2. I saw nothing in this survey about public transport. Does the municipality consider transportation? This community depends too much on self-regulation (ie complaints). When Council passes a by-law it must also debate the costs of enforcement, otherwise it is a waste of council's time. Given the demographics of Oak BAy, there is too little attention paid to road safety for seniors (e.g. crosswalks). While recognizing Council is trying to be supportive of businesses affected by Covid, the apace taken by restaurants on city streets is excessive: Pedestrians are hindered by businesses taking more than their fair share of sidewalks and now traffice is further congested. Council must communicate to Businesses that the current arrangement is TEMPORARY. Illegal suites in Oak Bay are getting out of hand. We have had a major increase in suites in our area; street parking is congesting traffice and we live on a "Fire Route". Council needs to pay far more attention to this aspect of public safety. District of Oak Bay Budget Questionnaire 2022 : Survey Report for 4 October 2021 to 24 October 2021 Bylaw Enforcement should not be complaint based. Damage to infrastructure caused by heavy equipment during construction activities should be paid for by the builder! . Since all Oak Bay ratepayers financially support the Oak Bay Municipal Yard, pedestrians should have access, not just those with vehicles. This could easily be accomplished with shorter access times/a marked path for foot traffic. Time to amalgamate, let’s consolidate our resources already! The Planning Dept. is overstaffed and overpaid. The Planning Dept. should be self sustaining. The Fire Dept. and Police Dept. salaries are too high. Too many Sr. level administration for the size of the community. Austerity in all areas except infrastructure renewal is needed. Everything possible should be done to increase funding available for infrastructure. Do your job and don’t spend money you don’t have. Hard work to make everyone happy. I love living in Oak Bay. Thanks for the opportunity to provide feedback. Please deliver on Carnarvon park upgrades without delay. Please coordinate with neighbouring municipalities and invest heavily to enable long continuous protected (physically separated) bike lanes across the region.

Council is there to serve the community and not to be the all-knowing "deciders." It's a job, folks, don't let it go to your heads. We believe that the most efficient way to increase housing density is by having programs that can be monitored. eg. duplexes, triplexes, fourplexes, laneway houses. These require new construction that can be monitored with fees by the municipality. Secondary suites are difficult to monitor and do not under present circumstances create any additional revenue for the municipality. Minimum lot sizes could dictate what housing is appropriate to each individual situation. I strongly support inter-community cooperation on community wide problem solving. It has always been a hallmark of human civilization that we cooperate and pull together to overcome our difficulties, rather than subscribing to devil take the hindmost. I say that from an Oak Bay perspective, with respect to broader community policing issues. Let's not allow civilization to slide backwards.

I would prefer a page in the local newspapers for monthly/quarterly reports - and/or monthly website updates sent to subscribers. Overall I am pleased with the level of service in Oak Bay with one exception - Dog Control - I live opposite [redacted] and as far as I am concerned there are far too many off leash dogs running along my street and sidewalk areas - I am unable to take my miniature dog outside for a walk on my own street due to off leash dogs, some of which are aggressive and the owners even more so. Last year I had 3 large off leash German Shepard dogs running across my property and tearing up District of Oak Bay Budget Questionnaire 2022 : Survey Report for 4 October 2021 to 24 October 2021 my back yard. Many dog owners walk their dogs across the road frontage of our properties and allow their animals to dump/urinate on our lawns and gardens. I've tried calling to report off leash dogs and I am told to take photographs - and if and when the dog catcher ever shows up you can guarantee it will always be at the wrong time. The efforts to keep dogs off Willows Beach are encouraging but there are still far too many off leash dogs - a couple of years ago my elderly neighbour was knocked over by an off leash dog at Willows Beach and she suffered a broken leg. People come to let their dogs run in the Oak Bay parks and beaches and many are not Oak Bay residents. The roads are a mess all over oak bay. There should be a comments box at the end of each major topic. In general, my feeling as a CPA is that the past council has failed in their ability to plan and be fiscally responsible. This lack of foresight has left the current residents of oak bay in a very difficult position of having to fund retroactively for services that have been ignored. As well, the many thousands of dollars spent on “studies” that go nowhere is almost comical. The one study that needs to be done ASAP is to determine by category or relative per capita spend on services starting with the largest budget items 1st. Thank you and have a good day. Am concerned that the animal control by-law is focused only on dogs. Cats are known to be the biggest bird predators yet dogs seem to be taking the rap for this. Regulation of cats is needed if bird management is a concern. We need to get Oak Bay on track with its infrastructure program. I expect affordability is a significant issue for citizens so I think the payment model choice needs to be based on evidence of what people can manage. Important to me are the maintenance of parks and other common spaces which are Oak Bay’s crown jewels. I believe the public arts program (like pianos, sculptures, concerts etc.) are a great, low cost, and accessible way to add vibrancy and joy to citizens and visitors. Our community is home to many experienced, good-willed, and committed citizens who want to see it thrive. Is there an innovative way to harness this enormous potential to help our municipality?

For heaven sakes fix the walking path at each end of the arched pedestrian bridge over Bowker creek just west of Hampshire where large pools of water accumulate with every rain !!!!!!!!!!!!!! I appreciate that Council is addressing the shortfall in funding prudent replacement of infrastructure. For too long this has been put off by previous Councils and the cost of catch-up and of servicing/repairing existing infrastructure is more expensive and disruptive than having a proper well funded program in place that will carry us all into the future. Current citizens must contribute to this, rather than leave for future generations as we have been doing by underfunding the timely replacement of underground and surface infrastructure. I urge Council to not make the same mistake with Active Transportation and Protected Cycling infrastructure. We have no protected bike lanes and only very limited bike lanes as mentioned above and even those lanes are dangerous for users because of the unprotected and fragmented design. So, get on with funding appropriate infrastructure updates with a proper depreciation/replacement program. But also get going on Active Transportation. Fund it properly and set out a plan to get it done over the next 5-10 years. That means complete, not sitting on the shelf being studied for year after year. Yes, all this means tax increases but with climate change we owe it to the current AND future citizens of Oak Bay. Stop tax increases except for pubic safety and health. Actions on the housing crisis are needed. I will not vote for any member of council, including the mayor, if Oak Bay doesn’t make strides (actions and policy, not surveys) to improve density, property owners’ and renter’s rights to do what they wish with their property. The number of un-related people living in the same house must be increased. Gardens suites, basement suites should be allowed. More town homes, etc. Density will improve budget issues. We should defund the bloated OBFD. See recent OBL post comparing Colwood VFD to Oak Bay. Likewise for the police department. Non - unionized staff should be used wherever possible.

Cyclists are doing fine on the roads, as long as they adhere to the rules and common sense Anonymous 10/21/2021 09:03 PM It is not simply about WHAT services and budgets. It is HOW you spend the | $and deliver those services. I would like to see more interdepartmental integration. An example was the repaving of the Rec Centre Parking lot: last summer: a six-figure expenditure to maintain the status quo (in a climate emergency), where many other positive outcomes (eg, active transportation, Bowker Creek stewardship, environment, water) could be have been accomplished currently with little or no cost increase. Yet the District's recreaton dept went ahead and seemingly ignored the Bowker Creek Blueprint, watershed plan, Active Transportation Strategy and the District's Climate policies. Anonymous 10/22/2021 04:03 AM On street parking especially in South oak bay should be on one side of the road that would increase safety for cars and bikes Anonymous 10/22/2021 10:42 AM Cycling infrastructure MUST be coordinated more effectively with Victoria and Saanich for safety and efficiency.

I would also like to see further enhancement of community arts events that would include community members. Over the passed few years, the addition of Public Art in the community has been extremely positive and well accepted. The art offers an additional level of value to our daily lives by making us think outside our usual routines and expanding our level of understanding of issues outside ourselves. The art compliments our surroundings. The ArtsAlive program has brought new interest to the community, more visitors which improves the economics of the area. It should be maintained at the very least. Oak Bays surface infustructer is deplorable. Most roads are heaved and un drivable. I can only imagine the condition of the storm and sewer system that appears to be collapsing on every road. Your District of Oak Bay Budget Questionnaire 2022 : Survey Report for 4 October 2021 to 24 October 2021 Anonymous 10/22/2021 05:55 PM policy on residential storm and sewer lateral lines is criminal , and is basically a form of organized crime. Charging a homeowner to fix a municipal issue on municipal property using only municipal workers, this is an abomination. No money is spent on parks or playgrounds and every municipal playground is laughable. Perhaps letting more denification on Oak bay ave could bring in more taxes to make Oak Bay great again. It is now no better than Saanich or Victoria. With services that are bottom of the barrel Additional considerations for outflow and stornwater management, as well as sewage upgrading of any septic fields should be considered. Municipalities, including Oak Bay, who impact shellfish and traditional harvest beds of first nations are in violation of treaties and breaking law. Municipalities should petition provincial government for necessary upgrades or find themselves in a tenuous legal position regarding violation of Indigenous rights to fish as formally, particularly in BC. Oak Bay needs a storm water management plan akin to neighnours in Washington like Bellingham, where raingardens and other low cost filtration options managed sewage, stormwater and roadway run off into water ways. Why are our beaches closed to harvest (a federal decision) due to municipal impacts and how will that be considered considered your climate change and sewage plan? Anonymous 10/22/2021 08:04 PM Move power lines underground on beach drive near water. Establish cost sharing with residents who will financially benefit. Possibly allow residents to put up a portion of the cost that could be refunded in future taxes. By removing the wires the value of the properties will be increased and therefore taxes will increase.

We can do much a much better job at leveraging our parks. Other municipalities have much nice parks. Better play structures. Sport courts, fields, etc. Why are we not doing more at Willows Beach? Can we not do better than the Kiwanis Tea House!? Where is the restaurant with live music, paddle board rentals, tacos and draft District of Oak Bay Budget Questionnaire 2022 : Survey Report for 4 October 2021 to 24 October 2021 beer, big patio, etc. It’s one of the best beaches in Victoria and we should be investing in it for all to enjoy. Look at what’s going on in Vancouver and how much enjoyment tourists and locals get. Let’s pump some life into Estevan Village and give it an OB/Cook St feel. Why is there a developer allowed to hold prime commercial for a personal gym! Let’s get a Penny Farthing like pub in there. Mixed use residential. I think there should also be some attention given to the peculiar intersection at Musgrave and Estevan. Lots of confusion and dangerous. My rant is over. Thanks for listening! Anonymous 10/22/2021 09:23 PM Council should prioritize increased space for walking, cycling and other alternatives to cars. Work to create people friendly environments rather than Oak Bay's historical approach which puts the needs of motorists above all else. Screen Name Redacted 10/23/2021 08:29 AM Bike lanes are important but should not as was done in the case of Richardson close off vehicular travel. It is time to develop sharing services with other municipalities - for instance sharing specialized public works equipment to reduce budget for acquisition of equipment. Also more fire and police sharing if services Anonymous 10/23/2021 08:57 AM Anonymous 10/23/2021 09:06 AM Anonymous 10/23/2021 09:15 AM We appreciate all of the garbage cans in Oak Bay. So very helpful when walking the dogs. The District needs to address climate change and sustainability in all aspects of it services and functions - we need shift away from a car and fossil fuel based community and focus on infrastructure replacement and upgrades and environmental protection to help us adapt to climate change. Council needs to find ways to increase our population density. Land costs are by far the biggest cost of homes and it is high time that Oak Bay recognized that putting single family homes on huge lots is problematic for housing costs and a host of environmental reasons.

Page 56 of 74 District of Oak Bay Budget Questionnaire 2022 : Survey Report for 4 October 2021 to 24 October 2021 Anonymous 10/23/2021 09:42 AM I believe more regulation and adherence to present bylaws re building and development in Oak Bay needs to take place, in our neighbourhood I notice that new builds are filling the lots often negatively impacting their neighbours, trees are regularly removed to increase the square footage of the new build and that previous marked public laneways that lead to the beach are being integrated into private property, this trend is very disturbing as those lovely pathways all through the Uplands and Oak Bay are gradually disappearing and public property is becoming private thank you Anonymous 10/23/2021 09:58 AM Thank you for the information provided and for the questionnaire. On the whole, I am happy with service levels in Oak Bay and would like to see them maintained. I am aware of aging infrastructure problems and support Council's plan for gradual replacement and modest increases to taxes. One on-going concern I have is the increasing number of dogs in the municipality and the requests by what appears to be a vocal minority of dog owners to have more off-leash areas. I fully support the requirement that dogs be leashed at all times on public property, especially in parks and on beaches (except in a few designated off leash areas). Willows Beach, in particular, should not be an off leash area at any time. I have observed many incidents of off leash dogs intimidating children, adults and other dogs, as well as numerous failures to "pick up" after off leash dogs. I believe there would be more families and seniors using Willows Beach if on leash requirements were enforced. More signage would be helpful. I have stopped pointing out on leash and summertime rules to dog owners because of the unpleasant and abusive responses I have received. Anonymous 10/23/2021 10:01 AM Too many of our parks look derelict, especially the small ones. Flower plantings would spruce things up dramatically. Anonymous 10/23/2021 10:54 AM Taxes are too high, especially staffing per capita. Cut staff at City Hall, especially in the Planning Department. Instigate more user pay.

Cadboro Bay at Oak Bay High and again at Bowker are great examples of useless spending while complaining that there is not enough money for infrastructure. Less frou frou, focus on boring basics. Priorities should be climate change action and missing middle housing and bike lanes. Put a staffed information centre in a neutral location to enable collection of Oak Bay Residents Opinions. Data on Oak Bay Business Management could be provided and explained. Hold Public Meetings Chaired by Facilitators, not associated by Oak Bay Council, on any contentious matters as identified by Oak Bay Residents. Consider amalgamation with Victoria. The scope of questions were very uneven. For example a question about the recreation centres, a huge and complex budget item, was followed by one about the issuance of permits for organized social actives (block parties, festivals, etc) which has got to be trivial budget item. If the purpose of the questionnaire is to identify areas might be scaled back in order to help address necessary infrastructure spending, the questionnaire does not appear to be useful. I support higher taxes and higher levels of community services (especially the library and those that provide for greater social equity), environmental sustainability and climate change planning. Infrastructure planning should be built on the goal of improving Oak Bay's environmental sustainability and resilience and bolstering the protection of the natural environment. -Consider senior transportation -More transparency and honouring of public information 1) Your bike lane infrastructure is dismal. Riding in Victoria and Saanich we have safe bikeways. You have only painted 500m of bike lanes in over 12 years. We need dedicated, safe routes through Oak Bay that connect with key routes in Victoria, Saanich. District of Oak Bay Budget Questionnaire 2022 : Survey Report for 4 October 2021 to 24 October 2021 Key arteries should have physical dividers. Myself and my good friend have both been hit by cars and almost killed (both requiring surgeries) - both 100% fault of the drivers. Cycling for recreation and commuting has exploded and you have not addressed proper infrastructure support over the last decade. You punt this down the road and it is a crisis of safety now as volumes increase (and with Richardson now spitting us all out into no-mans-land). 2) Recent Dog restrictions for beaches are way too onerous for what are urban beaches. We have to have some reasonable compromise with bird sanctuaries. We live in Oak Bay for the connection to the ocean with our entire family - including dogs. Providing a few 200m stretches of beach for dogs to run, swim, play off-leash is not unreasonable. Restrictions for key areas for nesting are understandable - but the entire coastline is now shut down and you need to negotiate with the feds for a reasonable balance on areas that are essentially urban beaches. 3) Outdoor Cats - your animal control is ticketing dogs off-leash but NOT cats running feral and doing way more damage to nesting areas than dogs. Cats are not licensed and should be! Cats are completely unattended and left to hunt prey endlessly with no controls or ramifications. 4) Speed control measures on King George / Beach Drive ocean roads. Speed humps (and not the ones that high-end cars can still absorb at 80kms) and traffic circles should be installed. We are plagued with late-night speeders ripping at over 100km knowing enforcement is a game of luck and odds in their favour on getting caught. We need to create physical impediments to slow people down. 5) Garbage/recycling service - I would be happy to keep levels the same if the garbage and recycling bins were bigger. The small bigs are NOT reasonable for 2 weeks - this results in people taking domestic trash to public garbage cans at beaches/parks. Let's get a system that manages proper load. Thank you for taking yard cuttings now too!!!! I understand the need to invest in core infrastructure such as sewer and water, and these should be council’s priority. Initiatives such as adding EV charging stations should only be done if users cover the full costs. We have lived in Oak Bay for 35 years and are very concerned about the increases in property taxes and other fees levied through water bills. I would like to see council critically look at current programs and trim expenses to focus on core services. Public art is nice, but not essential. We survived without it in years gone by. If council wants to support this program it should be completely covered through private sources. This includes installation etc. I am a cyclist and do not think we need more bicycle lanes in Oak Bay.

Increase of cycling lanes at the expense of car lanes is not good. Many of the seniors will be caught in traffic jams that increase pollution and the carbon footprint. RE #26 and #1: Off-leash dog areas need physical separation from pedestrian and play spaces. An increase in off-leash dog areas should occur only if accompanied by substantially increased enforcement of animal control bylaws at all times of day, but particularly in the early mornings and in the evenings along Willows Beach. Put up signs and collect some fines! The owners of dogs using our beaches and parks are all residents of Oak Bay. #33: Proactive enforcement of violation of short-term vacation rentals, rather than complaint driven enforcement, please. #34: Some public education regarding removal of noxious and invasive plants in neighbourhoods close to parks where volunteers and city staff put in hours and hours to removes the same plants. Also, more attention to removal of rubbish and yard waste along lanes and paths. THANKS. The time has come for legal secondary suites and tiny houses in Oak Bay (as long as the home owners also live on the property). This would allow our adult children to remain in and contribute to our community. Communication with Council is very frustrating. Public input is questionable with OB Municipality's skewed "surveys" & we the public feel that it's pointless to submit our opinions as the info will be manipulated in whichever ways staff & counsel feel it fits their agenda. Screen Name Redacted 10/25/2021 03:34 PM A couple of years ago a speed camera and digital display was installed for a few weeks on Monterey between Brighton and the Avenue. St. Patrick Street would benefit from the same idea, between Windsor and the Avenue, close to Brighton. Cars come through too quickly and there's a lot of pedestrian and cycle traffic crossing at Brighton (part of the Centennial Trail). Any chance of this being considered? Thank you.

Screen Name Redacted 10/25/2021 04:57 PM Maintain control of domestic dogs, increase control of domestic cats. Why are cats allowed to go off leash? Cats roam in other residents gardens. Why do cats not have licenses? Dogs are being discriminated against. Re: deer population, no more money spend until effectiveness is ascertained. Re: sustainable annual funding for sanitary sewer: program review needed- trim the fat. Re: tax- funded infrastructure: please look at program review first. In order to accommodate large swimming dogs such as Labrador Retrievers there must be a designated dog beach, such as Willows Beach Oct - May. We should not have to drive dogs out of our municipality in this climate change era, using up valuable fossil fuel. I think Oak Bay needs to bring some common sense to a federal regulation created in 1923 to control the hunting of birds. Council needs to show leadership, engage with the federal government and work out a compromise. We live here and need to be able to enjoy life. Re: charging stations: Citizens can pay to charge their own vehicles. Please do not require Oak Bay citizens to drive to Sooke or Cordova Bay in order to allow dogs off leash on a beach. How does this fit into climate mitigation plans for the world? I recognize that we all have to share space and be respectful of one another but we need to be fair.

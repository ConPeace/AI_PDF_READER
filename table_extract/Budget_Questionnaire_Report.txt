They are made of meat 11/03/2020 11:12 AM and some of us would love to trap and humanely euthanize them within our fenced yards. Screen Name Redacted Animal control should operate on a cost-recovery basis with no subsidy from 11/04/2020 04:26 PM rate-payors. Cats should be restricted to indoors but absent that any cats collected by animal control should be subject to a release fee at least equal to the cost of a dog licence (where the licence cost is set to achieve cost- recovery). As for deer...they are a nuisance but if the long term plan is simply about spending municipal tax funds then we should simply curtail our efforts. Screen Name Redacted Consider a cat licence since many in the District are "outdoor" cats. 11/05/2020 08:11 PM Screen Name Redacted I see more and more often people walking their dogs on the sidewalk without 11/05/2020 10:11 PM a leash. This should not happen as it is dangerous for both the dog and other people. I also see more and more cats wandering throughout the neighbour hood. Birds are impacted and cats often litter gardens, which is unhealthy. Screen Name Redacted For heaven sakes when does are tranquilized don't just inject contraceptives - 11/05/2020 10:48 PM EUTHANIZE THEM!! We are supposed to aim for a hundred mile diet to save the planet but we can't even grow a backyard garden and farmers aren't allowed to shoot the vermin. This is what is going to make sane people like me vote for assholes like Trump who would not tolerate this kind of insanity and would GET THINGS DONE!!!!! Screen Name Redacted We are being inundated with deer. Please increase the control. A proper cull 11/06/2020 12:20 AM is needed soon before the problem blossoms. This is urgent. Screen Name Redacted Deer come with ticks that may carry Lyme disease. Licenses for dogs should 11/06/2020 07:27 AM cover cost of animal control Screen Name Redacted Last year we saw less deer, but it has increased again this year. Otherwise, 11/06/2020 09:43 AM well done! Screen Name Redacted The deer are a dangerous problem and not just a nuisance 11/06/2020 10:08 AM Screen Name Redacted Please consider euthanizing the deer they are dangerous to the health of our 11/06/2020 10:25 AM community: deer cause cyclists to crash and break bones, deer leads to an increase in ticks which leads to an increase in lyme disease and lastly our Page 4 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire Screen Name Redacted please reduce the number of deer as soon as possible dogs eat deer poo which is just so gross! 11/06/2020 12:56 PM Screen Name Redacted 11/06/2020 02:52 PM Cats are left to roam all over the neighbourhood and should also be licensed. Screen Name Redacted 15 hours per week is not worthwhile, the municipality would be better to hire 11/06/2020 07:16 PM someone for less and increase the number of hours. Screen Name Redacted There are lots of social problems, including homelessness, drug addiction, 11/06/2020 09:21 PM etc. We cannot afford to put deer ahead of people. Screen Name Redacted Please deal with overwhelming number of deer in oak bay. 11/06/2020 10:45 PM Screen Name Redacted Deer population management should be done at the CRD level. 11/06/2020 10:53 PM Screen Name Redacted Deer population could be better controlled at low to no cost, (such as 11/06/2020 11:19 PM engaging local hunters) Screen Name Redacted I find that dog and cat owners are very responsible for their pets in Oak Bay , 11/07/2020 09:46 AM with or without licensing , and that urban deer are not a problem if you don’t speed and are willing to fence , or share plants . Screen Name Redacted Tiny house, totally barricaded yard. Expensive. Deer can dig under too, did 11/07/2020 10:00 AM anyone realize that? and they do. Cannot have veg or flowers or even new shrubs. No, there are actually NO plants deer will not eat if they feel like it. this is unaffordable and unfair. Screen Name Redacted Prohibit commercial dog walking in Uplands Park 11/07/2020 12:01 PM Screen Name Redacted No licence for cats. Deer are a problem. The numbers seem to have 11/07/2020 12:02 PM diminished from last year in Uplands area. Screen Name Redacted you do not comment on the effectiveness of what we are getting, nor allow 11/07/2020 12:18 PM for any qauntum of change possible Screen Name Redacted Make Cattle Point off limits to dogs off-leash all year round. Continue to 11/07/2020 02:32 PM protect sensitive habitats in Uplands Park from dogs by prohibiting off leash use during any seasons when of leash dogs will damage ecosystems. Prohibit dogs (even on leash) from the southern edge of Willows Beach from Bowker southwards. Allow off-leash dogs in Carnarvon Park before 09.00 and after 18.00 ( when sports users and toddlers will no longer be using the Page 5 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire park) to relieve pressures caused by restricting use at other areas. Screen Name Redacted Cats need to be licensed and not allowed to wander throughout the 11/07/2020 03:23 PM neighbourhood killing birds and doing their business in yards other than their owners. Deer need to be culled. Screen Name Redacted Much more control of dogs is needed. Dogs should be required to be on 11/07/2020 03:37 PM leash at all times in sensitive environment areas such as Cattle Point and Uplands Park. And existing dog controls should be policed and heavy fines imposed on owners who ignore regulations, e.g., many dog owners completely ignore the "no dogs on the walkway" signs at Turkey Head despite several very obvious signs. I know many people, especially older folks, who are afraid to go to some areas because of loose dogs. Screen Name Redacted outdoor cats should not be allowed at all!!!! 11/07/2020 04:56 PM Screen Name Redacted Oak Bay really needs to have an off leash park now that UVIC has 11/07/2020 09:33 PM disallowed use of its property near Mystic Vale. Please dedicate part of Willows Beach - the portion nearest Cattle Point - as a year round off leash area. It is disappointing to have to leave the municipality for off leash parks. The only ones I know of have limited hours when most people are working. Screen Name Redacted Oak Bay is violating Federal law by allowing dogs to roam leash-free 11/08/2020 09:09 AM throughout the GVH Migratory Bird Sanctuary. Acting as though it doesn’t exist. As though the reason for it is irrelevant. There is not only little enforcement, there is no educating the public on what this sanctuary is and why it is important to maintain safe harbour for migratory birds and the Eco- system that sustains them as they pass through or inhabit this region. — Also, it is well known the heavy toll free-range cats take on the bird population. Again, education, licensing (as with dogs), and enforcement. This is hard for us … we love our pets. But when we learn the cost of that love … Screen Name Redacted Save money. Shoot the deer 11/08/2020 12:31 PM Screen Name Redacted immuno-contraception is fine with me - I love the deer in my midst - just no 11/08/2020 05:51 PM pain or killing please to maintain population. Screen Name Redacted I would prefer to see more drastic measures to resolve the deer problem. 11/08/2020 06:07 PM Either a cull or at least 100% birth control and not just 80 does. Screen Name Redacted I think there needs to be a way to manage and use contraception or 11/08/2020 08:23 PM sterilization for the bucks. Going after the does only is not effective. It needs a multifaceted approach Screen Name Redacted Animal control is too much, deer are far more of a problem. 11/08/2020 08:42 PM Page 6 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire Screen Name Redacted Cats should require a license because there are too many wandering the 11/08/2020 10:14 PM streets and defecating in neighbours' yards. Screen Name Redacted not clear on value of contraception for deer; they are still eating everything 11/09/2020 01:46 PM and are still being hit by cars or conversely, being a hazard for cyclists. Screen Name Redacted It is ridiculous to allow deer to roam Oak Bay, causing traffic accidents and 11/10/2020 11:40 PM eating private and municipal gardens. Among other negative results, it has led to many back gardens with high fences, resulting in fewer neighbourhood chats. Screen Name Redacted This is waste of money. The method of UWSS is futile 11/10/2020 11:54 PM Screen Name Redacted Encourage municipality to license cats and require that they wear bells - in 11/11/2020 12:29 AM order to save our birds. Cats are as big a pest as deer when they are left outside to hunt and kill at will. Screen Name Redacted Is there anyway that deer can be monitored with less hardware? 11/11/2020 09:02 AM Screen Name Redacted I’m concerned about the danger of the deer in terms of car accidents, 11/11/2020 09:44 AM attacking people with small dogs etc. The male deer are getting alarmingly large and I still see numerous fawns every year. Screen Name Redacted The deer population continues to grow and too many human/deer 11/11/2020 10:01 AM interactions. Tagging deer does not work, would love to see deer relocated or hunted. Screen Name Redacted I think Oak Bay - both the municipality and community is doing a good job 11/11/2020 02:50 PM with pet control. You don’t see animals at large unless they have escaped, and using ROAM the community seems to come together to reunite them vs focus on impounding them. The deer are a work in progress, I’ve found the people applying the birthcontrol to be respectful when I have encountered them for land access. Screen Name Redacted Consider cull or mix of cull and contraception in future if the deer program 11/11/2020 03:02 PM doesn't demonstrate meaningful population reduction by next year. Keep working with province and regional municipalities to get deer management implemented more broadly. Screen Name Redacted Off leash dogs in parks where dogs are supposed to be on leash (ie 11/11/2020 07:00 PM Carnarvon) MUST stop!! Screen Name Redacted Less deer is better for Oak Bay 11/12/2020 09:09 AM Screen Name Redacted There are far to many deer in the CRD and all municipalities should be 11/12/2020 09:46 AM making a serious effort to significantly reduce the deer population in the CRD. Page 7 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire Screen Name Redacted The deer population will contain to grow out of control unless the entire 11/12/2020 11:57 AM regional district gets on board to reduce it. Screen Name Redacted There seemed to be just as many fawns in our area (Hampshire/Cranmore) 11/13/2020 01:36 PM as ever this year. Screen Name Redacted Cull the deer 11/13/2020 08:10 PM Screen Name Redacted It is very important to me tithe deer are reduced and that you work with other 11/13/2020 11:28 PM municipalities at the same time or their deer will become our deer Screen Name Redacted When will we know if the deer control methods are working? They don’t 11/14/2020 11:25 AM seem to be! Screen Name Redacted Rein in the super cop enforcing dog leash bye laws. This person seems to 11/14/2020 11:39 AM lack discretion and if he has time to spend enforcing the letter of the law less time should be spent. Screen Name Redacted Please take steps to effectively manage the deer problem. It is to the point 11/14/2020 04:09 PM where there is very little I can plant in my yard without it being destroyed. Screen Name Redacted We are spending too much for animal control. 11/14/2020 04:34 PM Screen Name Redacted Seems like upfront spending on deer control will yield long-term benefits. 11/15/2020 01:40 PM Screen Name Redacted Less money to inoculate deer - use other methods to reduce their number 11/15/2020 07:40 PM Screen Name Redacted I am soon to be a new dog owner, and a new home owner in Oak bay, so far 11/15/2020 10:23 PM I have not noticed a problem with dogs, I have noted a lot of deer! I am a gardener so i would certainly like to see the deer well managed. To be honest I don't care to have any deer roaming thru the oak bay area. Screen Name Redacted what ever you're doing with deer it's awful there's too many they are 11/16/2020 12:24 PM destroying everything they have no predators and are totally out of hand there isn't enough food birth control as you have it doesn't work I'm tired of deer crap all over my ;awns and no flowers left, please cull them The Mayor ran on a platform to do just that and then found he couldn't no more votes from me to any council member ... Screen Name Redacted Cats and dogs are not a problem...rotten ungulates are! 11/16/2020 02:17 PM Page 8 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire Screen Name Redacted The so-called deer management is having no impact on population. It's a 11/16/2020 05:43 PM waste of money. Dogs must be controlled (leashed) on beaches and in natural parks. Screen Name Redacted Cull the deer, use the meat! 11/16/2020 06:12 PM Screen Name Redacted Keep this program and enhance. Many does with fawns still roaming the 11/16/2020 06:31 PM district so perhaps they forgot to take their pills... really, no visible reduction in wildlife yet. Screen Name Redacted Reduce/eliminate the budget for deer. This is no longer a priority of the 11/16/2020 08:28 PM community. In addition, it would appear that we have learned to live with deer as opposed to eliminating them. Screen Name Redacted ALL deer in Oak Bay should be culled (preferably by First Nations hunters), 11/17/2020 05:42 PM butchered and used for feasts or donated to food banks. Screen Name Redacted I would favour regulations around cats (to prevent song birds from being 11/18/2020 06:35 PM killed). I want a reduction of urban deer by any means including culling. We're encouraged to do more urban farming but that's economically unfeasible with the current state of urban deer. Screen Name Redacted Stop Animal Control ticketing on pure technicalities, like it's 11:01 and your 11/18/2020 08:11 PM dog is still off-leash at Windsor Park, or your off-leash dog ran briefly out of the off-leash zone. This didn't happen to me, but I've heard from many people about cases like this. Screen Name Redacted animal control is always looking for people off-leashing dogs in on-leash 11/18/2020 08:35 PM areas, but people only do that because there is a serious lack of off-leash areas here. Also animal control officers are nice and polite, but does not wear masks, and will approach the owners within 6ft with out consent and will feel the dogs without consent. Some dogs are rescues and this can be an extremely traumatic experience and will destroy the work of the owners that they put in with the dog for years Screen Name Redacted Please, please, please make an off-leash dog area in south Oak Bay that is 11/18/2020 09:08 PM year round! Screen Name Redacted Eradicate the deer, by any means necessary 11/18/2020 09:27 PM Screen Name Redacted animal control should be called based on. Deer - instead of having annual 11/18/2020 09:57 PM immuno-contraception for the females, it would be more beneficial to sterilize the males. More costly (I assume) in the short term, but more cost effective in the long run. The only other reasonable option is culling. Screen Name Redacted Increase deer management with cull only 11/18/2020 10:06 PM Page 9 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire Screen Name Redacted Deer are more of a problem in our neighbourhood than dogs 11/18/2020 11:34 PM Screen Name Redacted Absolutely absurd amount of animal control after dogs. I was being watched 11/19/2020 11:09 AM by an animal control in his van, extremely creepy. He was watching my dog and I in a LEGAL park, the second my dog stepped one foot out of the boundary (and promptly came back to me when called) I was issued a ticket. It is embarrassing, find something better to do with your time. Screen Name Redacted My dog and I were chased twice in July by different does. One was so 11/19/2020 07:40 PM aggressive a passing motorist, who noticed us fleeing from the doe, slowed down and invited us into her car. Oak Bay should do more to control the deer population. Screen Name Redacted We need a good off leash area for dogs 11/19/2020 07:57 PM Screen Name Redacted 1. Pet licences should be increased in cost to help cover pet control costs. 2. 11/20/2020 02:51 PM Deer should be culled. An annual cull would be a fraction of the cost and the meat should be provided to local indigenous groups. Screen Name Redacted People who let their cats outside should have licenses so that when we catch 11/20/2020 03:00 PM their cat using our gardens as toilets we can know who to speak with about it. Also, they kill so many birds it is heartbreaking. Screen Name Redacted OMG the deer. 11/20/2020 03:41 PM Screen Name Redacted continued consideration of additional leash off locations, with full year 11/20/2020 03:50 PM accessibility, particularly during a pandemic scenario Screen Name Redacted 11/20/2020 09:02 PM Make sure the collars on the deer fit properly and do not rub their necks bare. Screen Name Redacted With the number of birds injured or killed by cats, consider limiting the 11/20/2020 09:17 PM number of cats, or keeping them indoors unless on a leash. collar & bell!? Screen Name Redacted Just finished the questionnaire. Suggest you use a more professional service. 11/20/2020 11:48 PM This site has allowed me several reponses and does not eliminate non- residents. Screen Name Redacted The deer population is out of control. I hate that I live in fear of someone 11/21/2020 11:32 AM being injured by an animal that normally RUNS AWAY from humans. It worries me that one of my kids will accidentally corner one in our yard and something awful will happen. Please find a solution to the deer overtaking our community. Screen Name Redacted There are very few stray animals in Oak Bay or Victoria for that matter. 11/21/2020 12:15 PM Citizens take in animals that seem to be lost. I think could be better spent Page 10 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire elsewhere. Screen Name Redacted Deer population should be eradicated. A buck now resided in my back yard. 11/21/2020 03:44 PM It’s destroying my yard and I can’t let my dog out unsupervised. Cull or ship them out. Screen Name Redacted Cull the deer population please. 11/21/2020 05:16 PM Screen Name Redacted Please reduce the deer- their population is growing, fast! Can’t we do a 11/21/2020 11:57 PM referendum on culling them? Screen Name Redacted A proper cull is required annually. The deer are a serious menace. Their 11/22/2020 12:06 PM feces is ubiquitous; they cause untold traffic mishaps and collisions; they decimate gardens; they are dangerous for children, and on. It’s way past time for the municipality to act more aggressively & to encourage other municipalities to do the same. These deer are not Bambi. Screen Name Redacted Outside cats should have licences. 11/22/2020 06:21 PM Screen Name Redacted the growing number of dog owners, and their dogs have put a strain on the 11/23/2020 09:53 AM beaches of Oak Bay and surrounding parks. The lack of patrolling and interaction with those who disobey bylaws needs a second look. Screen Name Redacted I submit it is very cost effective to neuter males which we should do. 11/23/2020 10:01 AM Screen Name Redacted Please introduce cat licensing. Too many roaming cats killing birds and 11/25/2020 10:10 AM digging in gardens. Perhaps, licensing can include awareness of how much damage cats are causing to neighbours and our environment. Screen Name Redacted The deer population is getting out of hand. Although, I do recognize they also 11/25/2020 02:08 PM exist in abundance in neighbouring jurisdictions so I don’t expect Oak Bay alone to try and decrease the population of deer without collaborating. Screen Name Redacted please do not bring in cat bylaws. Please continue to decrease deer 11/26/2020 11:20 AM population. They do not belong in urban environment. Screen Name Redacted Control of deer in Oak Bay is very important, as they are unpredictable and 11/28/2020 10:56 AM can attack people and pets. I can't even walk through my front yard/garden anymore, because every time I try a buck, or a doe stalks me. We don't need animal control to give tickets to people who are playing frisbee with their dog on a schoolyard when no children are present. Screen Name Redacted Most dogs are well-managed, but some owners let them run wild. Beaches 11/28/2020 12:54 PM and parks should be safely enjoyed by seniors and small kids as well as dogs and their owners. Screen Name Redacted Dog by-law needs to be amended. If dogs are off leash, they must be under Page 11 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire 11/28/2020 02:00 PM voice control of owner, otherwise they should remain on leash. If a person asks a dog owner to control their off leash dog, the owner must take control of the dog, and not let it continue to bother the other person. Screen Name Redacted Good work on the deer control. I hope to see fewer deer soon. 11/28/2020 02:59 PM Screen Name Redacted Start issuing fines to those who blatantly disregard on leash, off leash times 11/28/2020 05:40 PM and most importantly, fine those who let their dogs chase birds in the WILDLIFE SANCTUARY! I don't go to Willows anymore because some people are jerks and exercise their dogs by letting them chase the shorebirds. You tell them about how it is a violation of the Wildlife Act and they get angry and tell you off. How about some signs and fines! Screen Name Redacted Managing the deer population should be, by a wide margin, the number one 11/29/2020 10:49 AM priority. I don't know why deer can't be relocated to other parts of the Island. Screen Name Redacted Deer should be harvested by Lekwungen people as food sources as they 11/29/2020 01:42 PM originally were. Lekwungen people should set harvesting seasons, rules for harvesting. Screen Name Redacted We've seen a significant increase in deer populations in South Oak Bay. 11/29/2020 01:56 PM When walking our dog in the morning or evening when it's dark there have been some uncomfortable/threatening encounters with bucks, especially during rutting season. Screen Name Redacted We support a deer cull. 11/29/2020 02:41 PM Screen Name Redacted Licenses for cats. Mandatory belling of outdoor cats to help save the birds. 11/29/2020 03:55 PM Control deer by culling. Screen Name Redacted Why do we spend | $85,000 a year on trying to control deer populations when 11/29/2020 04:49 PM the biggest issues they cause is that they eat flowers in rich people's manicured yards. We should feel privileged to live with these creatures and encourage the creation of safe green spaces in our community rather than blasting the last few we have left to put in mansions. I'd also like to know where community members are supposed to legally dispose of animal feces? By law (according to the signage on private home black garbage bins) it is illegal to dispose of animal waste in the garbage and compost bins? Screen Name Redacted Please enforce bylaws requiring dogs to be leashed. They are off leash all 11/29/2020 06:38 PM the time in Carnarvan Park, so we can’t walk our dog near there as he was attacked in the park by an of leash dog and is now terrified of off leash dogs. We live beside the park :( Screen Name Redacted Publicize this is under Provencal jurisdiction ,not Municipal so Council are not 11/29/2020 07:25 PM held responsible for the problem. Page 12 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire Screen Name Redacted Deer are an increasing concern. Their impact is detrimental to safety and 11/29/2020 09:21 PM with no predators will only increase in numbers. Their numbers should be managed and controlled through economically means. Screen Name Redacted Stop spending on immuno-contraception. Deer do not belong in the city. They 11/29/2020 09:48 PM are vectors for Lyme disease. They are turning Oak Bay from a city of gardens to a city of fences. Screen Name Redacted Stop spending money on immuno-contraception. Deer do not belong in the 11/29/2020 09:50 PM city. Screen Name Redacted Please post visible signs advising dog owners about the off leash hours. On 11/30/2020 02:21 PM several occasions (in the afternoon) we've had to fend off dogs and ask the owners to leash them. Some dogs are aggressive and bark and they scare my young son who is allergic to dogs. This has been going on since we moved to Oak Bay - five years ago. Screen Name Redacted As the contraceptives work, less should be needed. Also, what thoughts have 11/30/2020 05:44 PM been given to controlling the buck's sperm? Screen Name Redacted Increase the dog license fee and encourage compliance to Animal Control 11/30/2020 07:20 PM Bylaws, for example, through having animal control patrol by parks earlier and later than Victoria Animal Control hours and answering phone complaints outside their office hours, as well as through better/clearer information signs. Dogs owners come with their dogs to the Willows Beach, Cattle Point, Uplands Park and Anderson Hill from other CRD communities and, as tourists, from communities on and off Vancouver Island. Most are responsible. A few may not know the Oak Bay by-laws and information would help. Some say they do not care about the by-laws and proactive enforcement would help. Screen Name Redacted Deer population control should be coordinated with all municipalities in 11/30/2020 07:50 PM Greater Victoria. Screen Name Redacted Keep up the great work 11/30/2020 11:18 PM Screen Name Redacted Set aside the Bambi sentimentality and get rid of the deer. Set a firm 12/04/2020 11:02 AM deadline and stick to it. Screen Name Redacted Require all cats and other domestic (household) animals/pets to be licensed, 12/10/2020 01:42 PM especially exotic animals. Use the | $85,000 to provide food (venison) to low income families Screen Name Redacted Anything to reduce the deer population is beneficial for safety on roads, 12/10/2020 02:01 PM backyards, front gardens and LIME disease. Pressure to join other areas of CRD to also join in this endeavour. Screen Name Redacted Need to get rid of deer population due to severe destruction caused to Page 13 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire 12/10/2020 02:10 PM properties in the community each year. Culling is preferable to immunization which does not appear to be working. Screen Name Redacted Time for deer to depart Oak Bay 12/10/2020 02:16 PM Screen Name Redacted Too much time and energy devoted to debating and worrying about deer in 12/10/2020 02:28 PM OB! Screen Name Redacted under 1 "slightly" was added 12/10/2020 03:15 PM Screen Name Redacted Deer population comment: "Coexist!" Wildlife predate the city and belong 12/10/2020 05:31 PM here! People need to make more concessions for the deer. Screen Name Redacted Domestic animals - no point in doing anything if you don't give it more teeth. 12/10/2020 05:45 PM For us, cats are a bigger problem than dogs. Screen Name Redacted The deer are becoming a very serious problem, basically destroying all plant 12/15/2020 03:26 PM life in their path. Since gardening is an important hobby/activity for my household, the deer really reduce my enjoyment of my garden. I support a cull, especially eliminating the bucks. If the contraception program is working, I have seen no evidence of it so far. This summer the deer ate more of my garden, and a wider variety of plant species than ever before. Screen Name Redacted Domestic cats allowed outdoors should be licensed & declawed, the latter to 12/15/2020 03:35 PM reduce cats killing birds. I have seen little data on the effectiveness of the deer contraception program. There has been no deer reduction in the area where I live. I believe a deer cull program would be a more cost effective program. Screen Name Redacted Hard to read.... 4 deer and a ??? cross our lawn every day in the extended 12/15/2020 03:52 PM summer.

I'm saying I want to maintain the increase already in the plan. Q5 I'm not in favour of spending money on assets we think we need to replace. This question is also confusing because you reference increased funding in the 5-year plan but then also say current funding is not adequate...are you saying the increased funding in the 5-year plan is not adequate? Overall, I don't feel the Municipality has a firm grip on the issue of buildings and am wary of offering any increased spending room in this area. Screen Name Redacted Post on the District web site a quarterly public list of areas which are sewer 11/05/2020 08:11 PM pipe upgrade priorities. Screen Name Redacted Our municipal infrastructure is critical to all residents. These must be 11/05/2020 10:11 PM upgraded and properly maintained. Screen Name Redacted Road pavement is actually in good condition EXCEPT almost everywhere it 11/05/2020 10:48 PM was dug up and POORLY REPLACED where gas lines and other pipes were laid. The companies who wreck our pavement should be charged for proper repairs - not taxpayers. Screen Name Redacted These are all essential services and needs to have enough funding 11/06/2020 09:43 AM Screen Name Redacted I value full lifecycle cost analysis when making these decisions. We should 11/06/2020 10:08 AM be spending will a good understanding of the future needs of these systems Screen Name Redacted Secondary waste treatment is a huge waste of funds in a fiscally tight period. 11/06/2020 10:08 AM Postpone all construction on waste treatment plants. Screen Name Redacted The town’s sewer and storm water infrastructure is a critical issue we all 11/06/2020 04:52 PM have to face and deal with. The system needs to be rebuilt. Screen Name Redacted Paving roads with an oil based asphalt does not help the environment. Road 11/06/2020 07:16 PM replacement should look at alternatives and reducer our dependency on carbon based services. Page 20 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire Screen Name Redacted These are silly questions. None of us know the issues surrounding these 11/06/2020 09:21 PM services. Screen Name Redacted "The current levels of service are not sustainable with current levels of 11/06/2020 10:00 PM funding given asset deterioration." If this is the case then please dont launch anymore pet legacy projects that have minimal impact such as that bike lane fiasco in front of OB High School. Screen Name Redacted The district needs to save money elsewhere to allow for increasing funds for 11/06/2020 10:17 PM water, sewer, storm drains. Many property owners pay too much already. The cost should be distributed more equitably, maybe based on type of dwelling and size of lot rather than by building value. Just because a house is newer or nicer looking doesn't mean they should pay more for these infrastructure facilities. This is a tough one when "no one" wants their taxes raised. But we need this. Screen Name Redacted 11/07/2020 10:00 AM Screen Name Redacted No descrption of what's now happening, nor the NEED for improvement. Our 11/07/2020 12:18 PM street has not been repaved for over 30 years! It is filled with potholes and patches over patches - very shoddy and not cost effective. Screen Name Redacted Critical that the municipality maintain and replace the aging infrastructure of 11/07/2020 03:23 PM the community. Screen Name Redacted Maintain present levels. 11/07/2020 03:37 PM Screen Name Redacted Many roads in Oak Bay need to be repaved as they are deteriorating. We 11/07/2020 09:33 PM also need improved sidewalks in some areas. Screen Name Redacted Encourage walking, active transportation, and safe (covid) public 11/08/2020 09:09 AM transportation, minimize the need for roadwork. Screen Name Redacted Oak bay looks aged and in disrepair, kind of embarrassing actually. 11/08/2020 01:17 PM Screen Name Redacted sidewalks are in dire need of repair and replacement, never mind the roads - 11/08/2020 05:51 PM people can be injured badly by crumbling sidewalks Screen Name Redacted I'd like to see more rain gardens and garden roofs. There needs to be a way 11/08/2020 08:23 PM of mitigating storm drain surges. All the contaminants run either directly onto the beaches and the Salish Sea and or into Bowker Creek and then the Salish Sea. Build bioswales at storm drain outlets that discharge onto beaches. Look at redirecting gutter run-off into rain gardens and lawns. Give tax incentives. Consider changing bylaws for new development and buildings/homes undergoing renos. Tax incentives for permeable sidewalks Page 21 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire and driveways Plant more trees to help absorb rain runoff Plant more grass on impermeable surfaces Any sewer discharge onto beaches is unacceptable Screen Name Redacted Infrastructure maintenance and replacement has been a huge issue in the 11/09/2020 10:14 AM area for many years, with previous governments unwilling to increase the tax base enough to keep the systems going. I would support increased taxation to fund infrastructure spending. Screen Name Redacted My intention is for the municipality to maintain current levels of service in 11/10/2020 11:40 PM these categories, not necessarily to maintain the same funding. If more funding is needed to keep handling stormwater drainage adequately, for example, funding should be increased. Screen Name Redacted Would like to see more road infrastrucutre expenditures re-directed to cycling 11/11/2020 12:29 AM infrastructure and Green roadworks - not just more of the same old same. Oak Bay is missing out on lots of opportunities to reduce GHG emissions by using traffic circles and traffic calming infrastructure instead of traffic light and 4-way stops. Need a much higher proportion of this budgets to help cyclists ride and park their bikes safely. Screen Name Redacted Pedestrian crossings in Oak Bay need to be updated. Roads are full of 11/11/2020 09:02 AM potholes and sometimes crossings aren't even visible until you are right there. Screen Name Redacted This category is important. Current levels of service should be maintained 11/11/2020 09:44 AM even if it means tax increases. Screen Name Redacted The roads are pretty bad in Oak Bay, love the areas where you’ve put in new 11/11/2020 02:50 PM paving. I bike and drive and really notice the poor roads, especially along Lansdowne. My focus would be the main roads though. I’ve also seen a lot of water issues (line breaks) in the area of late. Screen Name Redacted Please ensure new money put into infrastructure actually goes to 11/11/2020 03:02 PM infrastructure projects - this is most easily managed by contracting projects as needed. Screen Name Redacted Our services are in poor condition and need to be brought up to proper 11/13/2020 11:28 PM standards Screen Name Redacted Don't you have a fiduciary duty to maintain infrastructure in working order. If 11/14/2020 11:39 AM Capex is required on infrastructure then you need to do it. But funding must be more creative than raising taxes. At today's rates a low cost loan/ municipal bond? Sell the municipal hall property on Main Street for redevelopment. (Rebuild your offices in a the public works yard, above a new library?) Most importantly, funding should be made available from more efficient operations - this means more use of technology and more amalgamation of services/ capital spending. It is a great disservice to your constituents to raise taxes yet do nothing about putting the house in order. We don't need to be paying 13 fire chiefs across the region. It may be politically hard but it is the right thing to do. You may not get re-elected but at Page 22 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire least you'll be remembered for averting the disaster that awaits our grandchildren. Screen Name Redacted Please budget for sidewalks along both sides of Foul Bay Road (as the City 11/14/2020 04:09 PM of Victoria has done). This will not only make the road safer for pedestrians but narrowing the road will help to curtail the reckless speeding along it between McNeill and Oak Bay Avenue. Screen Name Redacted This is a really important service and I’m happy to see leadership on it and 11/15/2020 01:40 PM money spent on it. Screen Name Redacted I think additional funding should be allotted to OBPD to partially renovate 11/16/2020 10:29 AM their aging bldg., including expanding the change room for female officers who now are almost 50% of the department. Screen Name Redacted use dollars to fix infrastructure that's falling apart ...all extra dollar should go 11/16/2020 12:24 PM towards that . I love art and apparently it's not expensive but rather than spending on it I'd put it towards say fixing uplands sewer issues may no be much but anything helps . Screen Name Redacted Find ways to extend the life of existing infrastructure. Big spending on 11/16/2020 02:17 PM dubious upgrades has lead to out of control tax increases vis-à-vis other jurisdictions. Screen Name Redacted Road pavement budget reduction can also be viewed as a measure towards 11/16/2020 08:28 PM traffic calming. Reduced demand for roads due to Work/School-University and other services being offered/facilitated remotely should be accompanied by a proportionate budget decrease with funds going to areas of health/safety (clean drinking water, proper sewage) Screen Name Redacted Upgrade of cycle lanes in Oak Bay Avenue. The lack of cycle lanes is 11/17/2020 07:45 PM dangerous...more so with the temporary traffic calming measures that have recently appeared. As the road narrows, cyclists are pushed into the middle of a busy road with no protection. It is an accident waiting to happen. Screen Name Redacted Stop cutting trees that maintain drainage and water infrastucture 11/18/2020 04:33 PM Screen Name Redacted Please consider increased natural asset management to support flood 11/18/2020 04:47 PM mitigation/management i.e increased streams, natural water ways, foreshore etc. not everything needs to be expensive and engineered Screen Name Redacted It's well known that cities -- and Oak Bay is no exception -- that investments 11/18/2020 06:35 PM in essential infrastructure have not kept pace with needs. Screen Name Redacted Crack down on property owners letting leaves pile up in the drains. There is 11/18/2020 08:11 PM an empty house for sale on my block owned by a developer, and there are huge piles of leaves that build up around the drain in front of it. I raked it myself the other day. Screen Name Redacted Fund infrastructure repair and replacement as necessary Page 23 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire 11/18/2020 09:27 PM Screen Name Redacted Can’t dump overflow sewage in McNeill Bay anymore 11/18/2020 10:06 PM Screen Name Redacted I ran across an interesting street rehabilitation model in a U.S. city a few 11/19/2020 02:32 PM years ago -- Can't remember the city but it was in state not known for planning. The city laid out a 10 year plan street-by-street for resurfacing and subsurface work. They encouraged utilities to co-ordinate the timing of their work that affected roadways by working jointly on repair and installation (I realize there are union issues here that they didn't face there). On the deterrent side, the city levied very substantial charges for utilities or others who did work which broke through the road surface. These charges / penalties were very large initially and then decreased over time. This created both positive incentives to co-operate, especially on timing, and disincentives to not cooperating. Screen Name Redacted focus on health and safety 11/19/2020 07:57 PM Screen Name Redacted Roads are a mess despite big annual tax increases 11/20/2020 03:49 PM Screen Name Redacted A lot of potholes in Oak Bay! A lot of roads need to be re-paved. 11/20/2020 07:21 PM Screen Name Redacted Fix the potholes. Potholes are a hazard for those on bikes. 11/20/2020 09:02 PM Screen Name Redacted we must maintain our infrastructure, and expand/replace as needed 11/20/2020 09:17 PM Screen Name Redacted Can we put some budget into maintaining and beautifying the avenue 11/21/2020 11:47 AM businesses and buildings Screen Name Redacted I have had water in my basement due to storm drains being clogged, this is a 11/21/2020 12:15 PM priority for me. Screen Name Redacted Why am I paying for new sewer for multi unit houses with legal & illegal 11/21/2020 03:44 PM suites? They place excessive strain on public works and my wallet. Screen Name Redacted 11/21/2020 05:16 PM Uplands roads are very deteriorated. Cotswolds around Uolands and Weald. Screen Name Redacted Develop an Action plan to control & eventually eliminate Sewer & Storm 11/21/2020 07:00 PM water contamination at Outfalls. More information, maps of most affected Page 24 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire properties & homes should be made public along with a Long Term Replacement Cost amortization schedule Screen Name Redacted Please, we are overdue! Let’s aggressively invest in our infrastructure, even 11/21/2020 11:57 PM in COVID times. Screen Name Redacted Neil Street is collapsing directly under the sewer main. Entire landsdowne 11/22/2020 08:12 PM slope drain main surcharge during heavy rains . No infustrure upgrades are ever done , pipe lining , lateral inspections , half the homes dont even have cleanups. Oak Bays attempt at maintaining the sewer and storm infrastructure is pathetic at best Screen Name Redacted if additional funding is required to upgrade these issues this is where money 11/23/2020 09:53 AM needs to go, it is the foundation of our community. HOWEVER i am not on board with secondary suites to increase the tax base. Secondary suites will overburden the already stressed issues addressed here. Screen Name Redacted As a new resident of Oak Bay who just had their basement flooded out from 11/24/2020 09:04 PM a storm drain, we see the importance of maintaining infastructure.. Screen Name Redacted Your questions are loaded in that they all directed to “increase” answers. 11/28/2020 02:00 PM Screen Name Redacted I would pay more taxes for an infrastructure plan which rehabilitated all roads 11/28/2020 02:59 PM focusing on a portion each year. Many streets in deplorable condition. No annual upgrading program that I have observed. Screen Name Redacted I don't think it is fair that the majority of Oak Bay is subsidizing The Uplands 11/28/2020 05:40 PM sewer project. A less expensive option, that could have been completed by now was offered up but rejected for poor reasons. Too late now I suppose but in the future...... Screen Name Redacted By including the word "maintain" in the question you are priming respondents 11/29/2020 01:56 PM to select the middle option. This acts as an implicit cue to what you consider the acceptable/recommended response, even if that's not the case. Best to keep these neutral to hear the true position of residents. Screen Name Redacted While supporting increases for infrastructure investments we would want 11/29/2020 02:41 PM those increases to be predictable and affordable for home owners. Screen Name Redacted We need to fix things before they fall apart completely, and we are perilously 11/29/2020 06:59 PM close to that in a number of areas now. Our pavements are also shockingly degraded in some cases. Screen Name Redacted To do this would probably decrease our home insurance. And probably save 11/29/2020 07:25 PM a house or two Screen Name Redacted Keep the minimum increase in taxes to improve the above. 11/29/2020 09:28 PM Page 25 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire Screen Name Redacted Improve sidewalk accessibility (cutouts) for people/seniors with compromised 11/29/2020 10:32 PM mobility issues (walkers, canes etc) and for baby strollers. Also, would like to see traffic calming on Cranmore Road between St Ann stop sign and Beach Ave to address high speed vehicles given it's proximity to nearby playground. Screen Name Redacted Please post stop or yield signs where necessary. There is a lot of 11/30/2020 02:21 PM construction in the neighborhood and not everyone is familiar with speed limits and blind corner turns. Screen Name Redacted Covid has thrown a huge upheaval into daily living and life operations of 11/30/2020 05:44 PM government and businesses. We need the basics attended to first. Maintaining where reasonable but improving where necessary, or where past work has been a patch work set of solutions. Screen Name Redacted I assume that road infrastructure will be improved as required when 11/30/2020 07:20 PM drainage, sewer, or water infrastructure is improved and roadways are torn up. My "maintain" for municipal buildings means support for the current five year plan. Screen Name Redacted Maintain is good. Increase if there is a safety issue or can save money long 11/30/2020 11:18 PM term Screen Name Redacted Our road are a disgrace, whether you are in a car, or, even worse, on a 12/04/2020 11:02 AM bicycle. I refer you to Margate Street and Orchard Avenue as good examples of neglect of road services. Screen Name Redacted Public safety should be the #1 priority - road safety for vehicles, cyclists and 12/10/2020 01:42 PM pedestrians - no two-way cycling lanes! - buildings should be safe (earthquakes, tsunamis) and secure - drainage for health safety as per requirement (OSHA public health) & sewer maintenance - H2O yes for adequate fire safety Screen Name Redacted We had a major flood inside our house (lower level) in January due to no 12/10/2020 02:01 PM knowledge one should check & clean out exterior perimeter drains every 3 years at best. Ours (1961 built) probably never been examined. Many homeowners don't know to do this but a water bill notice could educate all. Screen Name Redacted Highest priority to replace roads and sewer to prevent future problems. 12/10/2020 02:10 PM Infrastructure is in terrible state. Screen Name Redacted We really must pay more now for infrastructure maintenance to avoid paying 12/10/2020 02:16 PM more later Screen Name Redacted or # 4 - please add safe, separated bike lanes. Ensure that Oak Bay adopts 12/10/2020 02:28 PM modern, structured asset management processes - see Asset Management BC for details. Start to measure, value and manage natural assets for infrastructure services. See MNAI.ca Screen Name Redacted comment for 5-9: I do not know the state of the maintenance level at present, 12/10/2020 02:52 PM hence I cannot make an accurate decision Page 26 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire Screen Name Redacted under 5 "as per 5-year plan" was added 12/10/2020 03:15 PM Screen Name Redacted I believe that it is necessary to sacrifice some "nice to have" programs while 12/15/2020 03:26 PM infrastructure renewal is completed. Infrastructure affects every resident, every day and must be a priority. Screen Name Redacted The assets described above are essential assets that must be maintained to 12/15/2020 03:35 PM meet future needs of the community. Reductions in non-essential areas should be seriously considered as a consequence in order to control costs. Unless the bylaw requiring property owners to pay for repairs to wastewater and sanitary sewer laterals under municipal property is changed (which it should be), in order to reduce the demands on municipal staff and workers, the property owners should be allowed to contract for the work to be done by qualified companies of their choice. Permits and inspections by the District would be required. Screen Name Redacted I think we should be reminded that money is needed to increase service. Are 12/15/2020 03:52 PM we willing to accept that?

Seek public input in advance of any proposed change to service in 11/05/2020 08:11 PM collection & distribution categories. 2. Publish a list on the district web site outlining planned leaf pick up schedule by street boundaries (current leaf collection is often late, haphazard and so unreliable many residents resort to taking their leaves to the Drop Off Depot). Screen Name Redacted The fall leaf crew sometimes lies about having been down our street. 11/05/2020 10:48 PM Screen Name Redacted hire or increase role of employee at the Elgin St Drop off to manage traffic 11/06/2020 07:27 AM flow. Screen Name Redacted Hopefully garbage will decrease with awareness of the 3 R's. Encourage 11/06/2020 09:43 AM composting - maybe a team that can give advice/helping hand instead of trucks collecting/all house hold driving to the Drop off Depot? Or a Block composting center? Screen Name Redacted Resident should be encouraged to mulch as much garden waste as possible 11/06/2020 07:16 PM on their property. Garden pickup should be fee-for-service option for citizens. Screen Name Redacted Vancouver picks up lawn trimmings every 2 weeks with oversized bins. With 11/06/2020 08:23 PM the taxes we pay, it should be once per month Screen Name Redacted Current schedule works. 11/06/2020 09:21 PM Screen Name Redacted I like the idea of allowing yard waste with compost. 11/06/2020 10:17 PM Screen Name Redacted The Oak Bay dump should explore options for increased revenues. Specially, 11/06/2020 11:19 PM the fill dump which has been closed to Covid, should offer online payment. There should also be a bin to allow for the disposal of wood and furniture, at a cost (profitable for the municipality). Finally, the dump should have green Page 31 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire waste deposited on the lower level on weekends to reduce congestion/ wait time. Screen Name Redacted Great job. As long as the stuff is actually being recycled?? 11/07/2020 10:00 AM Screen Name Redacted The rotating cycle of garbage pick up is beyond logic and rationale. We have 11/07/2020 12:18 PM a small yard and have made at least 6 trips to the works yard. Is this expected? Screen Name Redacted Quit separating those materials for which recycling options are either not 11/07/2020 02:32 PM available or involve off-island disposal Screen Name Redacted I'm not against these services but the amount of waste is appalling. Less 11/07/2020 03:37 PM frequent pickup might encourage people to use less (e.g., plastic wrappings and wasted food) and compost more of that which is compostable. Screen Name Redacted It is great to learn that starting in 2021 the municipality will pick up yard waste 11/07/2020 09:33 PM in the organics bin. Finally! Screen Name Redacted I live in an apartment building and do not have a vehicle - we need to be able 11/08/2020 05:51 PM to get rid of wrecked old furniture and electronics no longer working without having to pay a hauler | $100+ or finding someone with a huge vehicle Screen Name Redacted With yard waste disposal being added to the regular collection, would the 11/09/2020 10:14 AM twice annual leaf collection be necessary? Screen Name Redacted 2314 Oak Bay Avenue has insufficient garbage bins, issue raised at council 11/09/2020 08:14 PM meeting March 2018 when construction application for two new suites was discussed. Screen Name Redacted Oak Bay is doing a good job in this area. 11/11/2020 12:29 AM Screen Name Redacted I feel incredibly lucky to have our leaves picked up regularly..it’s such a 11/11/2020 10:01 AM wonderful initiative. Screen Name Redacted I live in Uplands with 9 Garry Oaks and several maples on my property so I 11/11/2020 02:50 PM prefer more fall/winter leaf pick up dates. I find recycling/garbage pickup frequency to be fine. I leverage Elgin yard a lot for metal/soft plastics/batteries... I think we need more education on separating soft plastics, the hand out is pretty good though. Screen Name Redacted Support the widest range of recycling and composting possible to minimize 11/11/2020 03:02 PM waste. We appreciate the expanded recycling options at the dump and the change to include garden waste in green bins. Keep up the good work! Screen Name Redacted Soft plastic pickup would be nice 11/12/2020 09:09 AM Page 32 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire Screen Name Redacted Weekly garbage, bi-weekly recycling and garden waste to be allowed in 11/12/2020 08:40 PM compost bins (picked up bi-weekly) Screen Name Redacted The unbelievable noise, pollution and total lack of care at the Elgin Dump 11/13/2020 04:21 PM with no concern for local residents and no proactive noise reduction program in place is a disgrace. If council can spend | $85,000 to control the deer population how can it not afford to institute a proper program instead of investing to increase the traffic and amount of garbage accepted - there is an alternative site way more suited to this operation but no effort is made to try to solve this massive issue Screen Name Redacted I didn’t know you were adding garden waste to the organics! If we’re 11/14/2020 11:25 AM spending much more on that it’s just silly! I save mine for spring clean up or take it to the dump. Screen Name Redacted No info on cost vs service level. It's nice to have garden waste pick up but if 11/14/2020 11:39 AM it's costly, I'm happy to bring to depot. The depot is a great service. Screen Name Redacted Regular garden waste pickup should be added (this is needed much more 11/14/2020 04:09 PM than a large compost bin). Screen Name Redacted Increase the number of composts bins available for residents dropping off 11/14/2020 04:34 PM compostable materials. Screen Name Redacted Really happy with the service level here. 11/15/2020 01:40 PM Screen Name Redacted I would like to see more pickup added for recycling, i.e. plastic bags 11/15/2020 10:23 PM Screen Name Redacted There needs to be much more fall leaf pick up in certain areas, what we are 11/16/2020 10:29 AM receiving now is not adequate. Screen Name Redacted make municipal yard more accessible and take more stuff 11/16/2020 12:24 PM Screen Name Redacted Extend the hours of the municipal yard. We are not all retired with unlimited 11/16/2020 02:17 PM time to wait in line-ups. Screen Name Redacted Leaf pick-up is not a high priority. It does not damage our environment. In 11/16/2020 08:28 PM contrast, less than optimal recycling options within oak bay (including driving materials to other communities) leads to abuse, improper disposal and damage to our enviornment. Screen Name Redacted Allow soft plastic recycling at curbside 11/16/2020 11:34 PM Page 33 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire Screen Name Redacted Collect glass as well. 11/17/2020 05:42 PM Screen Name Redacted no need for fall leave pick up. 11/18/2020 04:47 PM Screen Name Redacted Please add more garden waste collection days, especially in the fall. 11/18/2020 08:11 PM Screen Name Redacted Pleasant discovery to find out that yard waste disposal will also be allowed 11/18/2020 09:27 PM via the curbside organics collection program. Screen Name Redacted Perhaps limits on how much garden refuse/leaves can be picked up? Large 11/18/2020 09:57 PM estates can purchase passes/tickets for additional pick-up? Garbage/recycling etc changed to every 3 weeks. More emphasis on composting/recycling/sorting this stuff out of the garbage. Screen Name Redacted Leafs are dangerous for cyclists and pedestrians and hide dangerous objects 11/18/2020 10:06 PM for children and pets increase leaf collection Waste drop off can be provided by private enterprise if the municipality continues to provide the service it must be top-notch Would like to see yard waste picked up with the regularly scheduled waste pick up Screen Name Redacted I would restore the annual pickup of large household junk (e.g., furniture and 11/19/2020 02:32 PM the like). My justification is two-fold It would decrease the incentive for some people to dump those kinds of items in less travelled location as happens now. As well, it would produce a net savings to households-- while taxes might rise incrementally, this would be cheaper than one-off commercial junk removal. Screen Name Redacted encourage/educate to reduce waste 11/19/2020 07:57 PM Screen Name Redacted The leaf sucking services was a nice to have but too costly to justify in these 11/20/2020 02:51 PM times. Leaves can be put in gardens as winter cover, taken to Elgin or picked up by private company. Screen Name Redacted Where do our recycled materials go? Are they actually being recycled or just 11/20/2020 05:23 PM dumped? Screen Name Redacted Make sure everyone is aware of the bylaws around piles of leaves and other 11/20/2020 09:02 PM debris. Post signs at Windsor Park so leaves not dumped in parking areas. Screen Name Redacted Staff provided good service at the drop-off during Covid 11/20/2020 09:17 PM Screen Name Redacted It would be nice to have a fall pickup of yard waste as well as spring. 11/21/2020 03:44 PM Page 34 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire Screen Name Redacted Make it mandatory for Garden & Lawn Service Contractors to Dispose of 11/21/2020 07:00 PM Garden Waste at a designated municipal site themselves. The Municipality should not have to be responsible for pick up of ON PROPERTY leaves/garden refuse from ANY Contractor ( many pile the leaves out on the Blvd for municipal pickup .... at the COST of the Taxpayer Screen Name Redacted Love the dump facility! It is FANTASTIC 11/21/2020 11:57 PM Screen Name Redacted what is the revenue earned from the tonnes of steel. For sustainability many 11/23/2020 10:01 AM items that are scrapped are reuseable and save more for the environment that is garnered by the recycling fee in my opinion Screen Name Redacted The transfer station should be moved to a location away from the municipal 11/23/2020 09:39 PM equipment and vehicles parking lot, and Elgin Road neighbourhood, given the increasing number of vehicles that creates traffic and congestion there. Leaf collection should also be stepped up, especially on Haultain Road! Street sweeping should also be stepped up, and do both sides of the street, not just one! Screen Name Redacted Elgin street depot waits are too long 11/23/2020 09:43 PM Screen Name Redacted We appreciate the ability to use the municipal yard for recycle and yard 11/24/2020 09:04 PM waste. Screen Name Redacted 11/25/2020 02:10 PM The possibility of curbside glass or soft-plastics recycling would be amazing. Screen Name Redacted Given the pandemic and the closure of the public works office at the 11/28/2020 02:00 PM municipal yard, the Curbside Pickup Schedule cards should be delivered to homes, as it was in the past. Screen Name Redacted I wish we could put garden waste in our organics like other cities. 11/28/2020 02:59 PM Screen Name Redacted All good here. 11/28/2020 05:40 PM Screen Name Redacted But don't allow 'pickers' to take the valuables out of the metals bin....why don't 11/28/2020 07:07 PM we use the revenue towards Oak Bay Services instead? Screen Name Redacted For #10, it would be helpful for Oak Bay to communicate more clearly when 11/29/2020 10:49 AM the fall pick-up of leaves will be. Screen Name Redacted Residents should take personal responsibility for refuse beyond routine 11/29/2020 01:42 PM collection. Page 35 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire Screen Name Redacted Add more capacity for drop off at public works instead of increasing these 11/29/2020 02:39 PM services Screen Name Redacted Applaud the efforts on recycling. Particularly the yard waste disposal being 11/29/2020 02:41 PM allowed in organic curb side collection starting in January. Screen Name Redacted The district should work to introduce soft plastic recycling. It is shameful how 11/29/2020 04:49 PM much soft plastic is thrown out and how this district doesn't provide an alternative. The district should also allow renters to access the Eglin street drop-off depot. This seems like an arbitrary rule that is classist and detrimental to the environmental goals laid out by Oak Bay Coucil. Screen Name Redacted The CRD needs to establish a “Junk Day” again so I hope Our reps will work 11/29/2020 06:59 PM on that. Locally, we could also have “Scrap Metal Day”, “Styrofoam Day”, “Building Materials Day” and so forth to keep things we cannot dispose of at curbside out of the landfill by utilizing the parking lot at the end of Bee Street on a weekend day. Sell the scrap metal to offset the costs. Screen Name Redacted Do more if it is done profitably. 11/29/2020 07:25 PM Screen Name Redacted Pleased with our services. 11/29/2020 09:28 PM Screen Name Redacted Great news about yard waste being included with organics! Will a sufficiently 11/29/2020 10:32 PM sized bin be made available (free or for purchase) to accommodate this change? Screen Name Redacted Access to Elgin allows owners to drop yard waste as needed. Many home 11/30/2020 05:44 PM owners already have service agreements to manage their yard waste. Local governments do NOT need to duplicate these services. ELGIN is a very effective service for just that! Screen Name Redacted 10: Yard waste. The 2021 collection with organic waste is a great initiative 11/30/2020 07:20 PM that is approved by my "maintain" response. Screen Name Redacted great job 11/30/2020 11:18 PM Screen Name Redacted Increase metal ( | $) recovery education (even staples can be recovered as 12/10/2020 01:42 PM metal) Screen Name Redacted Maybe education to the public about (free) value of fallen leaves on garden! 12/10/2020 02:01 PM Raking also is exercise while not bothering neighbours with noise! Shredded leaves are wonderful for garden beds / vegetable beds - people need workshops on this. Screen Name Redacted Weekly garbage pickup would be an improvement. Page 36 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire 12/10/2020 02:10 PM Screen Name Redacted Comment for #10: we are "spoiled" as many Canadian cities stopped this 12/10/2020 02:44 PM decades ago Screen Name Redacted for #10: I would like to see a curbside pickup in the fall as well as the spring 12/10/2020 02:52 PM Screen Name Redacted Yard works is a very important part of life in Oak Bay 12/10/2020 05:09 PM Screen Name Redacted Recycle plastic bags 12/10/2020 05:31 PM Screen Name Redacted Start pickup of soft plastics, styrofoam, etc. 12/10/2020 05:41 PM Screen Name Redacted A very good system to use the Rec Centre to collect compost materials by 12/10/2020 05:59 PM placing bins on the parking lot. Very convenient. Screen Name Redacted #10 = nice to have 12/15/2020 03:26 PM Screen Name Redacted Property owners requiring more service can drop off materials at the Elgin 12/15/2020 03:35 PM Street Drop Off Depot and at the Hartland Landfill facility. ??? services are also available. Screen Name Redacted District Council should consider solid waste removal weekly during the 12/15/2020 03:58 PM summer months, or at least in July & August, when weather is hottest and garbage smell is the worst!

They are not 11/02/2020 09:05 PM paying taxes yet use infrastructure, take up road side parking etc. Screen Name Redacted Respond to issues raised on twitter to District. Right now, response ever 11/02/2020 10:02 PM from District, unlike other municipalities, e.g. View Royal, Saanich, Colwood, who respond to issues addrssed to them on twitter. Screen Name Redacted Less public participation, the public is stupid, planners and council are smart 11/04/2020 12:00 PM enough to put the developments where they make sense, and everything else is less controversial anyways Screen Name Redacted Stop letting lobby groups (bike coalitions especially) lobby and abuse staff 11/04/2020 03:41 PM and residents at meetings. They don’t live here. Screen Name Redacted Engaging with this community is a waste of time. Don't confuse dealing with 11/04/2020 04:26 PM leaf blowers as addressing climate change. Think bigger. Screen Name Redacted We need to be prepared for climate change impacts. Rising sea levels, 11/05/2020 10:11 PM intense rain and wind storms need mitigation strategies. Screen Name Redacted If we want to mitigate climate change by decreasing our carbon footprint we 11/05/2020 10:48 PM should have a hundred mile diet which is impossible with marauding deer and Canada geese and utterly incompetent local, provincial and federal politicians who have dragged-out royal commissions preventing farmers from shooting them for free and instead nitwit governments put an insignificant dent in the problem by injecting contraceptives in deer and hiring someone to kill geese at a cost of | $750. per goose. This merits rioting in the streets !!! Screen Name Redacted Why. does secondary suite study takes so long? Council loosing credibility. 11/06/2020 07:27 AM Also OCP. in 2014. too vague. Why are links to reports completed not provided? Screen Name Redacted allow for secondary suites and garden suites as people are living here 11/06/2020 09:43 AM already illegally. Higher density in the city is better and reduce sprawl into green spaces / forests Screen Name Redacted We are under prepared for Climate Change, we need to both act to mitigate 11/06/2020 10:08 AM and build resilience within our community Screen Name Redacted Climate change should not be taken on at the municipal level. Case in point 11/06/2020 10:25 AM is Victoria suing Alberta. This is a waste of time and effort. Climate change should be provincial and federal. I am a strong climate change proponent, but not believe it should play a role in municipal politics. Screen Name Redacted The public participation period allocates two minutes for each person. This is Page 43 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire 11/06/2020 07:16 PM too short and 5 minute allotments should be allowed. Citizens should be notified when there is a plan to remove large trees; posting information on the website is inadequate and suggests public input is not encouraged. Screen Name Redacted It seems like the muni spends so much time and | $researching and public 11/06/2020 08:23 PM enquiries and external reports and consultants to only get shelved. Money spent but nothing really achieved Screen Name Redacted I believe Oak Bay is not contributing its fair share to social problems like 11/06/2020 09:21 PM homelessness, unaffordable housing, etc. I have a friend who wants to sub divide in Oak Bay. A Garry oak tree is taking precedent over another housing unit. A tree should not take precedent over people. Screen Name Redacted In the past council has passed quite major changes to building bylaws etc 11/06/2020 10:17 PM without making sure that residents know about the proposed changes in advance. In such cases all residents should receive emails and mailed notices letting them know about any proposed changes long in advance (6 to 8 weeks for large changes that could impact building on the type of property that a resident owns). I was appalled that such huge changes could occur without soliciting resident views openly and transparently. Same with proposed changes for properties near your. I once received a notification with only 2 days to respond with any concerns. That is really quite ridiculous. Lastly, the district needs to hold the school district accountable to follow bylaws for school lands. They currently do not abide by bylaws when it comes to erecting playground structures (and the district supports them by allowing this), and they do not follow even their own policies which require consultation with residents (but they ignore this) . Same with animal control. Dogs are frequently off leash on school grounds and they are used like dog parks, and the district does not act. It is the district's responsibility to ensure that dogs on are leash and that playground structures are not erected without concern for neighbours. Noisy and very tall structures should be addressed with limited operating hours if placed without consultation or near residences. The district emails (that you can sign up for) should just say what the main issues being discussed are in the email, rather than having to hit a link. Screen Name Redacted Increase usage of social media for engagement. 11/06/2020 11:19 PM Screen Name Redacted So wish surveys could be emailed, which I am told they cannot. Hard to be 11/07/2020 10:00 AM sure we get on the website to see them on time. and so many will not be bothering... Re. community plans. Trees (even on private land) are a community resource. Continue to protect them rigidly, do more even. Build less huge houses and use the larger lots to subdivide for several smaller homes. Not to do so makes nonsense of claims about supporting housing. We don't need super costly megahouses here. Screen Name Redacted Communication all acceptable however, the use of social media limited to 11/07/2020 12:02 PM those circumstances when conventional communication is also maintained. Not everyone tweets or uses Facebook. Page 44 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire Screen Name Redacted Your messages do NOT reach the public. This is YOUR problem, not ours. 11/07/2020 12:18 PM Ad absence on the weekly newpapers does not offset the daily Covid 19 briefings Screen Name Redacted Until this survey, I was unaware the District of Oak Bay had a Facebook 11/07/2020 12:58 PM page. I am now following, in addition to Kevin Murdock's page. Screen Name Redacted Do not agree with banning gas powered garden tools. 11/07/2020 03:23 PM Screen Name Redacted Most things in this category could be done more efficiently, thereby saving 11/07/2020 03:37 PM money. Screen Name Redacted I feel informed of what is going on in Oak Bay. 11/07/2020 09:33 PM Screen Name Redacted Climate change and all issues related to preserving and protecting our 11/08/2020 09:09 AM natural areas must be given priority. That includes our parks, which are suffering from poor infrastructure and over use. Biodiversity is essential for resiliency to our changing climate. That is being lost by the minute through neglect and abuse of what little remains of our parks. Screen Name Redacted Updating sewers, flood mitigation, and water transport to housing IS climate 11/08/2020 10:19 AM change mitigation. Screen Name Redacted This municipalities contribution to climate change is the same as a goose 11/08/2020 12:31 PM pissing in the ocean. Stop all money spent in this area Screen Name Redacted Pass Secondary suites already, and allow density   ♀   ♀  11/08/2020 01:17 PM Screen Name Redacted I would like to see more time given to community input for art installations. 11/08/2020 08:23 PM And I would like Council not to make up its mind prior to Community input as was the case with the location of the 'wolf' sculpture Screen Name Redacted Concerned that the Oak Bay Lodge will be turned in to a homeless shelter 11/09/2020 01:09 PM which will negatively impact our neighbourhood and village. As residents on nearby Hampshire Road we are worried about our safety and quality of life. The majority of potential residents will most likely have mental health or drug addiction issues and with a school so close by this doesn’t seem like a good fit. Screen Name Redacted Improve content to identify long term plans and projections 11/09/2020 03:46 PM Screen Name Redacted #15, all personal efforts to get action by Bylaw enforcement officer complete 11/09/2020 08:14 PM waste of time. Page 45 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire Screen Name Redacted Oak Bay needs to spent more attention on community-wide initiatives to 11/11/2020 12:29 AM address climate change/reduce GHG. Lots of missed opportunities due to lack of a progressive planning and building framework that would favour building conservation/preservation/smaller scale and energy efficient replacement homes as opposed to current approach which favours demolition/landfill/waste/monster homes. Council needs to address this NOW. It is 6 years since OCP renewal, and still no decent planning and zoning framework in place. Budgeted amounts for this work in 2022/23 are grossly insufficient. Screen Name Redacted Emphasis should be on projects that impact the well being of the community 11/11/2020 09:44 AM as well as climate change so that the money spent serves a dual purpose. Screen Name Redacted I live in Oak Bay because I wanted to be in a community without the issues 11/11/2020 02:50 PM you often find around cheaper rentals and low income housing i.e. Victoria or Esquimalt. It’s a privilege to live here, and I don’t think the definition of affordable housing is the same everywhere. I’m also concerned that input appears in social media to be one sided and impractical on certain issues. I see a rep of Oak Bay pushing the leaf blower agenda and only seeming to encourage input that supports her position. I don’t see the other side of the coin being discussed - the large Oak Bay lots with trees where older residents cannot rake. The cost impact to replace existing equipment by residents and Oak Bay , the additional cost in man hours of using the electric powered equipment that doesn’t work as effectively. Screen Name Redacted The new financial and progress reporting is great - I just saw it for the first 11/11/2020 03:02 PM time and really feel I have a good sense of the work underway in the municipality. While Climate Change is clearly a major issue, please focus on investment in reducing municipal impacts and don't go too far down the rabbit hole of incentives or behavioral change for residents - the environmental benefit per dollar is generally very small as the participants in those types of events and programs are generally already believers and actively engaged in mitigation measures. Just make it easy for people to do the right thing when they are ready (organics pickup is a great example). Screen Name Redacted I think that expenditures in this area could be made more efficient and 11/12/2020 11:57 AM focused without any increases in budge. Screen Name Redacted We don't need an expensive public communications specialist. But there 11/13/2020 01:36 PM must be more transparency. Whoever was doing this job before should be able to handle this; if not, hire someone else capable at the same salary. Screen Name Redacted Mitigate and adapt to climate change??? - cutting down the trees around the 11/13/2020 04:21 PM Dump and not replacing them and deliberately delaying doing so - long lines of cars idling down Elgin for hours - polluting the air to the point some elderly residents are unable to sit in their front yards. Altercations happening between residents unable to get out their homes etc etc Screen Name Redacted Please get on with the OCP we have been overconsulted It is past time for Page 46 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire 11/13/2020 11:28 PM implementing Screen Name Redacted Amalgamate. Given the population size all the duplicate planning, policies, 11/14/2020 11:39 AM much of which is probably replicated across municipalities, seems ridiculous. Screen Name Redacted All zoning and development decision must be subordinate to a up-to-date 11/14/2020 04:09 PM and forward-looking OCP. Screen Name Redacted climate change is not a proven problem, however we do have a problem with 11/14/2020 04:34 PM the health of our beautiful earth. OB should focus on getting sewer out of the storm drains, planting more trees (everywhere!), and banning harmful pesticides and herbicides. Screen Name Redacted I have not felt OB has been open or communicating well with building plans. 11/14/2020 09:40 PM The shape of the community is changing rapidly with large homes being built where old homes have been torn down. There is no overall plan or consultation on preserving the character of the community and environmentally sound practices (for instance regulations on lighting around the house). Screen Name Redacted Once again I am a new home owner here, so difficult to comment too much. 11/15/2020 10:23 PM Screen Name Redacted Get moving on the secondary suite/laneway housing policy...it's only been, 11/16/2020 02:17 PM what, a decade in the making? Screen Name Redacted Having acknowledged a climate change emergency, Oak Bay needs to take 11/16/2020 05:43 PM strong, urgent action engaging community. Screen Name Redacted Public engagement and participation in community development and 11/16/2020 06:31 PM redevelopment needs to be increased dramatically from its present level. Screen Name Redacted Rapid increase in OCP implementation, secondary suites, parking reduction, 11/17/2020 09:51 PM safe routes for biking, less planning more doing! Screen Name Redacted Re Develop land-use policies: 1st Priority correct broken Zoning bylaw and 11/18/2020 04:33 PM stop overbuilding lots. Re Climate Change: Stop cutting trees and destroying the environment - Reinstate Environmental Committee. Screen Name Redacted Improve communications; more natural asset management for adapting to 11/18/2020 04:47 PM climate change Screen Name Redacted Climate change is the biggest issue facing humankind. Get on with initiatives 11/18/2020 06:35 PM like bike lanes and secondary suites that make an impact. Don't "green- wash" other pet initiatives (like banning gas leaf blowers) and pretend this is where you can make your biggest mark. (I do favour limiting hours of us but that's as far as the municipality should go.) But there are bigger issues you Page 47 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire should be dealing with. Screen Name Redacted OCP updates: just get it done and stop waffling. 11/18/2020 09:27 PM Screen Name Redacted My experience with some of the engagement processes was disappointing. 11/19/2020 02:32 PM Much seemed pro forma, while other times the consultation seemed to be used by opponents to block work by processing the consultation to death. It seems the issue isn't budget allocation as ensuring an effective and efficient process. Screen Name Redacted Oak Bay Public engagement is an absolute joke. Engagement is more than 11/19/2020 05:56 PM listening to the community. It means responding to concerns, explaining why municipal decisions were made.Having a conversation. I defy Staff or Council to point to one change to Oak Bay as a result of the three Community meetings held last year. The minutes of the meeting were so sanitized. I will never attend another. Why not have community members take the minutes and post them unchanged. densification should be viewed as positive; need more multiunit development Screen Name Redacted 11/19/2020 07:57 PM Screen Name Redacted There is only one priority really: climate change. Any and all resources 11/20/2020 03:41 PM necessary should be diverted to address this issue as much as possible. Screen Name Redacted Climate change is a global issue, look after Oak Bay! 11/20/2020 03:49 PM Screen Name Redacted re land use policy: I do not pay 10k annually in property taxes to live next 11/20/2020 03:50 PM door to a homeless shelter that puts my kids at risk, if nothing else, to very visual suggestive negative behaviour (as experienced by Christ Church Cathedral school when the tent city existed on the Victoria Courts location). With the billions of dollars the government invests in housing, alternate solutions should be available (or made available) closer to the amenities to service this client group. Screen Name Redacted No point in having an OCP when Council routinely ignores it. 11/20/2020 07:21 PM Screen Name Redacted Make it easier for people to access electric car charging stations. Incentives 11/20/2020 08:43 PM to use electric lawn mowers for sound and environmental reasons. Screen Name Redacted Respect local knowledge and ensure that decisions are informed by local 11/20/2020 09:02 PM knowledge Screen Name Redacted A notice on this survey should have been sent to my house. You manage to 11/21/2020 03:44 PM send me bills when you want my money yet don’t notify me when there is a survey. I’m paying taxes and I want input how it’s spent in my community. I Page 48 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire found out about this survey from a notice to my kid’s school where 30% of student are out of the catchment and don’t pay taxes in my community. One survey per household and verification on submitter. Or hold referendums. Screen Name Redacted Do not approve secondary suites!!!!!!!! 11/21/2020 05:16 PM Screen Name Redacted There is no public consultation with the public on anything that is actually 11/22/2020 08:12 PM needed. The only time we here from council is when Hazel Braitwate is selling bacon and Eggers at Willows. Screen Name Redacted With respect to climate action, please do NOT ban the use of gas powered 11/24/2020 12:21 PM leaf blowers in the municipality due to the unintended consequences to home owners such as: higher costs for maintenance, inability to afford additional help with garden care loss of employment among landscaping companies etc. Screen Name Redacted The district and the council should be contemplating and seeking out voices 11/24/2020 11:40 PM that are not currently present. If these voices are not engaging with the processes in place is there anyway to attract them, should we find a way to go to them. Screen Name Redacted printed budget questionnaire available at Oak Bay Rec Centre is in a 11/26/2020 11:20 AM completely unacceptable point size. It is not readable by most people. Documents should be in 12 point at least. 14 point is readable by most people, even those with some sight disability. There needs to be a strict land use and listed buildings plan which is enforced. Screen Name Redacted Social media is not something everyone wants to be enrolled in. You should 11/28/2020 02:00 PM not be relying on Twitter and Facebook to “communicate”. Communication is a back and forth, if you are just posting on social media, you are not engaging the comminuty. Screen Name Redacted We already have diverse housing options. Stop wasting our tax dollars on 11/28/2020 02:50 PM exploring ways to density. This does not serve Oak Bay payers. Screen Name Redacted For #16, Oak Bay doesn't necessarily need to spend more money on land 11/29/2020 10:49 AM use policies, they just need to be less bureaucratic, make quicker decisions and be more efficient. Screen Name Redacted Provide more affordable housing. 11/29/2020 01:42 PM Screen Name Redacted [1] We've lived on our street in South Oak Bay for over 10 years and we've 11/29/2020 01:56 PM only had one year without construction. The constant noise, interruption, dust/dirt, damaged lawn, and inconvenience has become unbearable, especially for those who work from home or are retired. Not sure what can be done, but the ongoing infill is destructive to the peaceful enjoyment of our neighbourhood. [2] We're not interested in further densifying Oak Bay with multiple unit dwellings. If people are looking for a wider variety of housing Page 49 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire options there are plenty of nearby neighbourhoods like Fairfield and Fernwood that offer those options. Let's please keep what makes Oak Bay unique and desirable. [3] We need to attract more retailers to the Oak Bay Village and Estevan Village and we need more community events. Would love to learn more about the history of Oak Bay, including the indigenous history. Screen Name Redacted More EV charging availability. Consider light post charging like has been 11/29/2020 02:39 PM done in other areas of the country Screen Name Redacted The District has some distance to go for fully and meaningfully engaging the 11/29/2020 02:41 PM public in all aspects of governance and decision making. For two examples, citizen input and presentations at advisory bodies; routine postings of land use application on District website in a timely fashion. Screen Name Redacted More information from Building and Planning should be on your website, like 11/29/2020 03:55 PM upcoming development applications and permits. Develop a municipality wide set of rules regarding heritage buildings to help prevent demolition. Screen Name Redacted The municipality sure does put up a whole lot of Christmas lights and they 11/29/2020 04:49 PM remain up and lit for a long time... not a very green initiative. Or a culturally diverse one. Screen Name Redacted Don't build a lot of charging station ,look forward to LNG,HYDROGEN and 11/29/2020 07:25 PM NUCLEAR power sources. Screen Name Redacted All climate change initiatives are embedded in the actions of every 11/30/2020 05:44 PM department, development project, service and operation. Why does there need to be a stand alone Climate Change Committee/Project. There is much work already identified. Decrease e-communication, as you see necessary for effective ongoing communication. Dulication is not helpful if one excellent mode is effective! Screen Name Redacted Communication is paramount. The municipality is not good at it. Example: re- 12/04/2020 11:02 AM development of land owned by OB United Church - signs up for months, never a date on them, nasty Community response and signing, then suddenly big redevelopment signs disappear. What happened? Why no redevelopment at all? Screen Name Redacted - OCP should be on a 10-year plan to allow for finances, etc - Just make one 12/10/2020 01:42 PM COVID report when provincial state of emergency is declared - Climate changes constantly, so just leave it to nature and adapt individually. I enjoy the hotter summers! Screen Name Redacted Getting rid of gas powered leaf blowers is a great initiative! I am very upset 12/10/2020 02:01 PM about lack of public input to Designate 785 Island Road house. There could have been a public hearing before Council ??? to force Designation so they could gauge public Screen Name Redacted Further develop our municipal climate change strategy to be more 12/10/2020 02:22 PM independent and resilient with less federal and provincial reliance Page 50 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire Screen Name Redacted Oak Bay is coasting on climate change - please take it seriously! 12/10/2020 02:28 PM Screen Name Redacted Street tree plantings and municipal gardens should include draught tolerant 12/10/2020 02:35 PM and native species rather than greenhouse plants Screen Name Redacted The District should seek some cost savings for non-required services.

this category Screen Name Redacted Now that UVic has closed its park, there are no securely fenced off-leash 11/02/2020 03:06 PM areas for dogs in Oak Bay. Fenced dog parks are a necessary part of a city's infrastructure, allowing all dogs to exercise safely - regardless of whether they have a flawless recall around deer, squirrels, or other distractions (which for many breeds and mixes takes years - the very years that young dogs most need exercise.) It's especially important for residents of condos who may not have access to a yard of their own in which their dogs can get the necessary exercise to be relaxed, well-behaved members of the community. Screen Name Redacted Carnarvon Park play area needs to be upgraded. Oakdowne Park should be 11/02/2020 09:05 PM fenced. There are no fully fenced off leash dog parks in Oak Bay. Screen Name Redacted Carnarvan Park in dire need of upgrade. Why are parks in north Oak Bay 11/02/2020 10:02 PM given a lower priority than elsewhere in the municipality? Screen Name Redacted Focus on maintain, not build or new. 11/03/2020 02:05 AM Screen Name Redacted Make McNeill the dog beach and ban them completely from Willows 11/04/2020 12:00 PM Screen Name Redacted Q31 is interesting. I don't see the Municipality having any role in ensuring 11/04/2020 04:26 PM marina services are available. If leasing the land offers a good return then I have no issue with maintaining the practice but if all we are doing is ensuring marina services are available then we should probably ask whether it would be more profitable to run those services directly as with rec services. Screen Name Redacted The Victoria Harbour Migratory Bird Sanctuary in its entirety should be off 11/05/2020 10:11 PM limits to dogs off leash. This will help all birds to feed and rest I disturbed. Screen Name Redacted Over the years I have repeatedly complained about the water that covers the 11/05/2020 10:48 PM foot path most of the winter at each end (especially the north end) of the little pedestrian bridge that crosses the Bowker creek in the park. Everyone passes the buck and tells me to call someone else. It would not be very expensive to raise those areas. I wish you would go for a walk there after a rain. Screen Name Redacted Limit size of marina. It seems to be expaning; Turkey Head should remain in 11/06/2020 07:27 AM district and not be rented out to business. Unfortunately some dog owners ignore regulations and do as they please. Dogs should be on leash at all times in busier parks. willows Beach Uplands Park Anderson Hill. rather than only at certain times of the year. Screen Name Redacted decrease non-native planting and cultivating - let the wildflowers bloom Page 64 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire 11/06/2020 09:43 AM Screen Name Redacted I value more maintenance of outdoor areas that facilitate COVID safe 11/06/2020 10:08 AM activities, such as walking in uplands park. Much trail maintenance is needed in Uplands Screen Name Redacted We have a lot of art which we should be proud of, but I'd rather see more 11/06/2020 10:25 AM beautiful trees added and a focus on our nature instead. More trails, more opportunities to get out in fresh air and marvel at our nature please! Screen Name Redacted “Rewilding” areas of parkland should be a core principle in the urban forest 11/06/2020 07:16 PM design. Rewilding not only improves the environment for flora and fauna, it reduces maintenance costs , and helps to reduce the carbon footprint. Rewilding is essentially restoring the natural habitat with indigenous species that have bee removed for cultural purposes, like grass. Screen Name Redacted Oak Bay does a great job in this area 11/06/2020 08:23 PM Screen Name Redacted please do not remove any parking at the marina. It is an important spot 11/06/2020 10:00 PM where people can go to enjoy the area without impacting residential parking Screen Name Redacted Since you have these dog off leash areas, people should use them rather 11/06/2020 10:17 PM than having dogs off leash in areas where they should not. An example is the Cadboro Bay field at Willows Elementary, where dogs are frequently seen off leash, noisy, run at people other than their owners, and leave excrement. Screen Name Redacted Expand the skate park Add additional basket ball courts 11/06/2020 10:53 PM Screen Name Redacted Let's not have people donating art of their choice. That takes choice and 11/07/2020 10:00 AM fairness out of the public's hands. Bad sentence, sorry. And I already commented on the priceless nature of our community trees. Be even more vigilant. People who can't deal with that do not need to buy in OB. This is a community resource and private individuals must buy into that. No one in this muni is too poor to take that on for each other - we are seniors and pretty low income, but we manage. 6 Garry oaks and more... Screen Name Redacted Paint the parking lot lines in the Carnarvon park lot. This would utilize the 11/07/2020 12:01 PM parking lot to capacity and keep overflow parking off neighbouring residential streets. Screen Name Redacted Love public programs! Car shows, market day on the avenue, Christmas 11/07/2020 12:02 PM lights, art walk, .. wonderful. Screen Name Redacted Focus on infrastructure priorities - not art and culture. Art programs are 11/07/2020 03:23 PM available by other organizations. No need for increased off-leash dog areas as many dog owners do not adhere to current policies and allow their dogs off-leash constantly. Page 65 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire Screen Name Redacted Most of these operations could be done more efficiently. 11/07/2020 03:37 PM Screen Name Redacted Oak Bay has many trees but many have become dangerous and need to be 11/07/2020 09:33 PM removed and replaced even if protected. Expand off leash areas in North Oak Bay - Cattle Point is hardly a great off leash park as it has a road running through it. Proceed with Carnarvon Park revitalization. Screen Name Redacted If we don’t provide the proper infrastructure (trails, fences, signage) for our 11/08/2020 09:09 AM natural parks, together with protection from over-use by free-range dog walking, our parks will continue to struggle as intact ecosystems. Screen Name Redacted With regards to #31. Do not increase the marina dock space. The boats 11/08/2020 08:23 PM anchored at random in the Bay need to be managed. There doesn't appear to be any way of knowing who owns what boat. Some boats appear derelict. Boats should not be allowed to drop anchor wherever they like. Most are anchored in sensitive Eel grass beds There are now 2 small docks anchored in the middle of the Bay. There doesn't seem to be any policy for the timely removal of wrecked boats off beaches Remove the 2 derelict marine way structures from the beach If a marina is allowed to continue in its current location, it must have sani-pump capabilities. It must not be allowed to discharge any solid or liquid contaminants in the Bay. Refer to and implement the recommendations from the Eel Grass Report of 2015 Screen Name Redacted As budgetary constraints are always a concern, perhaps the public art 11/09/2020 10:14 AM installations should be at the bottom of the list with such infrastructure concerns as we have. Screen Name Redacted As a resident I appreciate the opportunity to get out and get exercise with my 11/09/2020 01:17 PM dog. Like the vast majority of dog owners, it is invaluable to have off leash areas and we respect the rules including the months when I can't have the dog on the beach or in the parks. Please maintain the off leash areas, as we have lost a big one recently. (Not being able to use the Cedar Hill corners/University space anymore) Screen Name Redacted Public parks and spaces are showing significant deterioration. Needs public 11/09/2020 03:46 PM collaboration, support and funding. Screen Name Redacted Oak Bay should budget for a full-time archivist; public art initiative is great, 11/11/2020 12:29 AM but more tax-funded contributions to the acquisitions fund, or better outrech initiatives to invite public donations. Would like to see greater investment in street tree replacement and expanding the urban forest on public and private lands. Screen Name Redacted Love all the new art work that pops up around the district! 11/11/2020 10:01 AM Screen Name Redacted Very happy with how Oak Bay is currently managing all the issues. 11/11/2020 02:50 PM Page 66 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire Screen Name Redacted Public art is great - I put down "decrease" only because I want to see a shift 11/11/2020 03:02 PM in focus towards more significant works - i.e. fewer | $5,000 works and more large, commissioned pieces. Also expanding focus to include other art types (written, performance, dramatic, etc) would be beneficial (I know, not in COVID year). Screen Name Redacted please limit public art to the village center only. kep it out of marine and 11/12/2020 06:06 AM naturalareas. Screen Name Redacted Too much construction in parks destroy the benefits of having natural areas. 11/12/2020 11:57 AM Love the OB Recreation programs! Screen Name Redacted Residents and visitors shouldn't have a small cohort foisting questionable 11/13/2020 01:36 PM "art" on the community. Most of the "artworks" displayed do not enhance their location. Taxpayers shouldn't be funding such eyesores. Screen Name Redacted A better effort and policing are needed requiring property owners to protect 11/13/2020 04:21 PM the urban forest and Uplands Park especially the endangered Gary Oaks which are being ravaged by Ivy - this is easily done and at reasonable cost Screen Name Redacted All archive services should be online/ digitized - no staff/service required. 11/14/2020 11:39 AM Amalgamate parks dept with other municipalities/ region or at the very least joint purchasing especially of expensive capital equipment. Replace the ROB pool - put library and municipal offices above in new building. Sell other properties. Screen Name Redacted Cultural programs must be lower priority than getting basic infrastructure 11/14/2020 04:09 PM modernized. Screen Name Redacted Keep as many areas as 'natural" as possible. 11/14/2020 04:34 PM Screen Name Redacted Please ensure that trees and shrubs (including blackberry bushes) are 11/14/2020 06:04 PM pruned away from sidewalks, such as along Beach Drive. When the sidewalks have overhanging branches, it narrows the available space for pedestrians. Pruning allows walkers to maintain a physical distance while walking along the sidewalk. Thanks. Screen Name Redacted Maintain parks and green spaces by finding dog owners for leaving feces 11/14/2020 09:40 PM everywhere and for allowing their dogs to run all over the preserved naturals areas and humans. It's disgusting on the fields, school fields, beach areas and paths. Too many dogs off leash, too much poo. Screen Name Redacted It all seems very well-managed. 11/15/2020 01:40 PM Screen Name Redacted I am a pickle ball player so would definitely like to see more pickle ball courts 11/15/2020 10:23 PM and more off leash dog parks. I enjoy hiking and walking so any added trails would be great! Page 67 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire Screen Name Redacted Carnarvon Park is in desperate need of redevelopment, and the process 11/16/2020 12:00 PM begun by Mayor Jensen seems to have stalled. With increasing numbers of families in North Oak Bay the facilities at Carnarvon, and the quality of playgrounds in general, is a problem. Relative to Victoria and Saanich, the playgrounds in North Oak Bay are older, less accessible, and smaller than comparable parks. The water park at Carnavon is heavily used and in relatively poor condition. The lacrosse court is an eyesore. Given Oak Bay's relatively low property taxes (compared with other municipalities), and high property values, there is not excuse for under investment in parks and recreation. Screen Name Redacted Everything in this category can withstand reduced expenditures. Learn how 11/16/2020 02:17 PM to say no. Screen Name Redacted Areas for off-leash dogs must be provided away from natural area parks, 11/16/2020 05:43 PM which are under threat from un-managed use. Park and playground areas are needed more than ever for outdoor activities. Urban forest protection and renewal should be expedited and increased (see climate change). Screen Name Redacted There is a distinct difference in providing programs (Arts initiatives), versus 11/16/2020 08:28 PM enabling program (facilities, parks). Government should enable but not be a service provider. Partnerships with specialist individuals and organizations should be developed to offer programs Screen Name Redacted Diversified group of individuals that curates public art. 11/17/2020 05:42 PM Screen Name Redacted Question 32: would need to see the RFPs to better determine an answer to 11/17/2020 09:07 PM this question. Screen Name Redacted By ticking the "increase marina services" I support a marina being there but 11/18/2020 06:35 PM would like Turkey Head to have better public amenities. Leasing that space out as a parking area is a terrible use of prime waterfront space and makes it seem "private" not public. I would even support food trucks in that space over film trucks. Screen Name Redacted We need more off-leash dog space. Windsor is great, but it's only till 11 am 11/18/2020 08:11 PM (and only till 9 am in the summer). An equivalent space in the afternoon is necessary for people who want to run their dogs after work. Screen Name Redacted there are essentially no off-leash dog parks around oak bay and there is a 11/18/2020 08:35 PM serious need to make one considering how many dogs live in the area, and how much money is made from the dogs and owners (pet businesses, pet products so the taxes, expensive annual licensing) Screen Name Redacted a fenced, off-leash dog park that operates all year round would be amazing. 11/18/2020 09:08 PM Screen Name Redacted Too many art installations. Detract from the natural beauty of our community. Page 68 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire 11/18/2020 09:27 PM Screen Name Redacted There are no fenced/secure off-leash grass parks in Oak Bay. These should 11/18/2020 09:57 PM be located throughout the municipality - North Oak Bay, South Bay etc. Should be community oriented so that people walk there with their dogs and should be open for the majority of the day - perhaps 6 am to 8 pm (regardless of the season). Screen Name Redacted Staff and Council showed how little they care about Parks, Rec and Culture 11/19/2020 05:56 PM when that shut down the Commission. I am sure the PR&C staff are quite happy. Screen Name Redacted Some of the public art, particularly the wolves at Haynes Park, the crow with 11/19/2020 07:40 PM the phases of the moon, and the whales sculpture, are wonderful, but much of the so-called art on public display is either very ill conceived or too amateurish. Screen Name Redacted there really are no off leash parks in Oak Bay; the options are to work with 11/19/2020 07:57 PM the SD or fence Lafayette Screen Name Redacted Playgrounds have been neglected in Oak Bay for years. We are under 11/20/2020 01:00 PM served in accessible play spaces/equipment. It is not enough to replace one piece of equipment with another similar piece of equipment. We must look at the whole space and re-imagine it's use for all children/needs/abilities. Screen Name Redacted Please let dogs use an area of willows beach in the summer before nine am 11/20/2020 03:00 PM and after 6 pm Screen Name Redacted The boat launch at Cattle Point is massively overburdened and should be 11/20/2020 03:41 PM upgraded to include a dock. Screen Name Redacted my family appreciates, uses and has used regularly many of the parks, & 11/20/2020 03:50 PM playgrounds in Oak Bay. They are very much appreciated and use will continue as funding should. Having outside areas to naturally receive vitamin D and socialize during a pandemic (outdoor open safe and beautiful locations) has been critical and is so important to for health in general Screen Name Redacted The marina would be nice if there were more little shops, a space for farmers 11/20/2020 08:43 PM markets and art markets and cafes. Screen Name Redacted For the sake of climate change and reducing noise and exhaust pollution, 11/20/2020 09:02 PM you need to replace the noisy, polluting, gas powered grooming tools used in our parks with electric tools. The tractors used for cutting grass are too noisy for use in neighbourhoods. Screen Name Redacted It would be nice to see more family friendly times available at both oak bay 11/21/2020 11:32 AM Rec and Monterey centre. It seems that seniors get all the primo time slots and people with young children aren’t considered as much. Screen Name Redacted 80% of the public art is ridiculous or an eyesore. I don’t want my tax dollars Page 69 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire 11/21/2020 03:44 PM spent on frivolity when we have an aging infrastructure. Focus and enhance on what is unique about Oak Bay. For example, plant more oak trees. And what’s with the big nuts on the lawn of the municipal lawn? We have the biggest cajones on the island?!!? Screen Name Redacted Please add benches along all streets that lead into the village. Many many 11/22/2020 12:06 PM residents have mobility issues and would walk more if there were places to rest en route. This is an essential priority. Further, the sidewalks are a disgrace. Nowhere in Oak Bay are there smooth, flat two-person sidewalks. This is an URGENT problem. Please walk with someone who uses a mobility aid—-cane, walker, —and see for yourself. Screen Name Redacted Once again literally the worst parks in the city . Carnarvon park is a disgrace. 11/22/2020 08:12 PM Lacrosse box is falling apart , tennis courts are shot. What was done ? A bunch of meeting about possibly fixing it in the next 20 years , sad Screen Name Redacted Uvic should be more supportive of off leash areas by not closing the "dog 11/23/2020 10:01 AM walk" on Cedar Hill Cross Road. Screen Name Redacted The marina could become more accessible to more people with broader uses 11/23/2020 09:43 PM like classes, more focus on kayaks, paddle boarding, rowing and dinghies. Screen Name Redacted Increase number of sessions and availability to skating during COVID-19 11/24/2020 09:11 AM Pandemic. Add evening sessions for those who have to work during the day. More sessions and increase capacity if at all possible. We are ALL in this Pandemic Together! Screen Name Redacted Oak Bay has some of the greatest scenery and nature areas in Victoria! 11/24/2020 11:40 PM Screen Name Redacted Anderson Hill Park should be zoned on leash only and number of dogs 11/25/2020 10:10 AM limited. We have witnessed dog walking business vans pulling up with numerous dogs set free to roam at will. In recent years, the park has lost the quail and experienced a severe decline in indigenous spring wild flowers. Screen Name Redacted Restrict dogs at Anderson Hill Park, please. The quail are gone and wild 11/25/2020 10:31 AM flower species are much diminished in recent years. And artwork, too much of a good thing — sculptures everywhere! We live in a beautiful environment, why do we need all this artwork to compete with the natural beauty? I love the stag and wolves by the marina, but so much else is more eye sore than enhancement. Less is more! Screen Name Redacted Oak Bay does an excellent job of providing Rec Centres, parks and cultural 11/26/2020 11:20 AM activities. Screen Name Redacted No large structures should be built at 1327 Beach Drive. The natural space 11/28/2020 02:00 PM needs to be preserved. Screen Name Redacted I would like to see the indoor pool expanded or another one built but due to Page 70 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire 11/28/2020 02:59 PM the pandemic I think core services and improving road and sewer/ drainage infrastructure should be the priority. Screen Name Redacted The district would not have to do so much work around tree management if 11/28/2020 05:40 PM rules were tightened up around the destruction of large mature trees in order for private landowners to build their giant, over-consumptive, environmentally unfriendly, dream McMansions. Sinful district response here. Screen Name Redacted There are a lot of invasive species growing on boulevards. Removal at parks 11/28/2020 07:07 PM has largely been voluntary, but I hope there can be at least some education to the public as those areas where there is overgrowth are overrun with rats. Screen Name Redacted Enhance natural green spaces. Decrease development. 11/29/2020 01:42 PM Screen Name Redacted We're spending a lot more time in our neighbourhood and we see this trend 11/29/2020 01:56 PM continuing for the foreseeable future. Having more parks and natural areas to explore, including trails with maps and signage and ideas for fun activities to do with kids, pets, and couples in the area would be amazing. Screen Name Redacted We have reached saturation point with public art pieces. Stop now with the 11/29/2020 03:55 PM annual juried competition that increases every year. Stop people from buying art to donate back to the community - if they like it so much they can install it in their yard. Remove current art that is anywhere within a block of the shoreline. Encourage the Arts committee to offer programs like art appreciation for kids in the summer or classes for seniors. Screen Name Redacted Heritage preservation should be seen as a priority. The more ugly concrete 11/29/2020 04:49 PM box homes this district certifies, the more it looks like Langford, and the less it looks like Oak Bay. I also question how necessary it is for the floral landscaping in areas such as Foul Bay @ Oak Bay Ave Garden, and Corbett's Corner to be replaced multiple times a year with annuals rather than planted with at least some perennial plants? Screen Name Redacted Trees should only be removed when they are diseased or when it is critically 11/29/2020 06:59 PM necessary, i.e. safety issues, not simply to accommodate a McMansion. For every tree that is removed for development, at least three should replace it. Screen Name Redacted Enough already 11/29/2020 07:25 PM Screen Name Redacted Sculptures should not be permitted where they compete with (ie damage) 11/29/2020 09:48 PM Oak Bay's wonderful natural views. Screen Name Redacted #21 - please do not clutter up Oak Bay scenery with multiple sculptures. The 11/29/2020 09:50 PM beauty of the natural scenery should not be compromised. Screen Name Redacted Clearer off leash policies and regular visits from animal services. 11/30/2020 02:21 PM Page 71 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire Screen Name Redacted To keep balanced budget, emphasize infrastructure management over these 11/30/2020 03:08 PM category of services. Screen Name Redacted Covid has redesigned the necessity of many of these services. Would this 11/30/2020 05:44 PM not be the time to reduce these expenses as these services are not able to be used? Also, could the Annual Art Installation Program change? Could tnis become an every 5 year event. There are many art installations in Oak Bay, while the roads and walk ways to see them are crumbling! The 4 years in between could have those finances go to, especially, road work! And, could not any and all home owners decide if they choose to have renters? B.C. housing standards sets what are acceptable living conditions. Renters will choose. Let the market place and individuals have the right of choosing, to have renters or where to rent. There is a Landlord and Tenant Board and process existing. Why duplicate that? More local government time on services not managed in other governments. Thank you! Screen Name Redacted Dogs off-leash times on Willows Beach, Bowker Point and Windsor Park do 11/30/2020 07:20 PM not need to be increased. People of all ages enjoy these public areas when dogs are not running off-leash. I am also concerned about increased harrassment of wildlife and birds along the shoreline if more areas become off-leash spaces. Screen Name Redacted Oak bay tea party!! 11/30/2020 11:18 PM Screen Name Redacted 29 - leads to more policing costs 30- leads to dog-dog, dog-human, human- 12/10/2020 01:42 PM human conflicts. All dogs should be leashed and under control of competent handler. Too much public art creates more controversy and leads to vandalism & then maintenance & repairs. Recreation centres is for enjoyment of residents & VISITORS Let natural areas naturalize (no maintenance required). Benches & picnic tables are often vandalized (eg graffiti, destruction) Playing field costs should be shared with user groups Playgrounds see comments on benches & picnic tables. Archives by donation and can be done online and with volunteers. Screen Name Redacted The tree protection bylaw should be expanded to allow a tree to be removed 12/10/2020 02:01 PM so a house can be moved off-site to a new location (and saved from landfill/demolition). Screen Name Redacted Let's go back to pre-Covid arrangements 12/10/2020 02:16 PM Screen Name Redacted # 29 n/a during pandemic 12/10/2020 02:22 PM Screen Name Redacted #20 comment "COVID 19" 12/10/2020 02:28 PM Page 72 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire Screen Name Redacted Less money on obscure (and often ugly) public art installations - more water 12/10/2020 05:41 PM fountains & benches on popular walks (i.e. Beach Drive along VGC etc.) Screen Name Redacted staff reductions at rec centres 12/10/2020 05:53 PM Screen Name Redacted In the areas where I have selected "decrease" in this section, I am 12/15/2020 03:35 PM suggesting these areas as potential for cost savings first & foremost Screen Name Redacted #31 - unless it currently provides significant tax revenue 12/15/2020 03:43 PM Screen Name Redacted illegible 12/15/2020 03:52 PM Screen Name Redacted #27 - Willows playground has layer of pebbles around the gazebo/slide area 12/15/2020 03:58 PM - these get scattered onto the walkway. Please sweep them back onto playground - hasn't been done in 6 months! Willows Park washroom: the disabled washroom door does not close, the knob should be replaced with a sliding metal tab, much better & easier to use than the knob which doesn't engage nor fit into the hole. It has been not working for 6 months now.

There should be a 11/02/2020 10:02 PM unification of public safety throughout Greater Victoria. One regional police service. One regional fire service, using the current facilities. No more toys for the boys vanity ladder trucks, each worth up to | $500K in each municipality. Municipalities should share these expensive resources. Screen Name Redacted Enforce parking regulations on streets other than Oak Bay Avenue. We have 11/03/2020 10:15 PM repeat offenders illegally parking in clearly designated timed areas. Due to zero enforcement, despite phone messages and now emails, these cars take up space that residents require. As well, emailing the Commissionaires is utterly futile. Screen Name Redacted Enforce parking if its needed, provide safe protected bike lanes in the Village 11/04/2020 12:00 PM and hurry up. Also, probably don't need a | $10 million police force. Surely you could whittle it down to 5 full-time officers, a couple of educated citizen members to educate/liaise, and then contract Saanich to do the rest, surely would save money Screen Name Redacted Parking infractions occur overnight and weekends - not the paltry 9-2:30 11/04/2020 03:41 PM hours that bylaw will actually attend. There needs to be a better option for homeowners to enforce residential parking zones. Screen Name Redacted Q34 - there is no reason not to look at a regional fire service...so when I say 11/04/2020 04:26 PM maintain it should not be seen as support for the status quo Q37 - parking should be cost recovery Screen Name Redacted 11/05/2020 10:11 PM Opportunities should be explored to share services with other municipalities. Screen Name Redacted Bylaw officers should FINE dog owners - not just give warnings. Dog owners 11/05/2020 10:48 PM blatantly flaunt the rules at Willows Beach. Home owners should be FINED for allowing hedges to grow on to streets and should be told to cut overhead branches at least 2 feet higher than they think because when they are wet they hang a lot lower. Bylaw enforcement should be financed through fines - not property taxes. Screen Name Redacted young people and work out groups get harassed frequently by police and 11/06/2020 09:43 AM commissionaires. What do we want public spaces to be used for? Screen Name Redacted Police and fire services should be amalgamated to keep costs down. Fire 11/06/2020 07:16 PM engines costs are enormous and the overhead to maintain the equipment and required training places a financial burden on citizens. Cost reduction though amalgamation should be seriously considered, Screen Name Redacted For a municipality as small as ours, the | $spent in this area is excessive. Old 11/06/2020 08:23 PM school mindset in this municipality has gotten us to the current situation Page 80 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire where we overspend in areas such as this but our infrastructure has been completely ignored. Poor long term planning and not sustainable Screen Name Redacted Let’s get rid of the costs for deer, beaurocracy around development permits, 11/06/2020 09:21 PM etc. and put this money towards a safer community. Screen Name Redacted Oak bay needs to fairly apply bylaws. You should not go after one resident 11/06/2020 10:17 PM for something many are doing without asking all to make change. Similarly, oak bay is hard on residents, who pay taxes that pay for the district's work, but then do not hold others such as school district 61 to account to follow bylaws and to treat residents fairly. The school district can lie, avoid dealing with residents concerns and not follow bylaws, and the district supports their actions. Residents should not be paying for the district's activities when they do not stand up for residents rights and rather appear to be protecting sd61. Screen Name Redacted Fire response should be greater Victoria wide, not oak bay, surely it’s 11/06/2020 11:19 PM incredibly inefficient to miss out on the economies of scale. Screen Name Redacted Great job by all... but would like to see some kind of blitz on speeding. That 11/07/2020 10:00 AM has not improved apparently, and is rampant, almost the norm. Screen Name Redacted New builds (with suites once legal) should be required to provide off street 11/07/2020 12:02 PM parking. Some area streets are barely passable because of the volume of parked cars. Screen Name Redacted Some bylaws are obselete and not workable. 11/07/2020 12:18 PM Screen Name Redacted Increase bylaw enforcement of dogs in Uplands Park. Level oylaw 11/07/2020 02:32 PM enforcement of dogs on playing fields seems to be fine Screen Name Redacted Considering there is only a part-time bylaw officer, I hear many many stories 11/07/2020 09:33 PM of people who feel harassed by bylaw. Screen Name Redacted no point in having laws and bylaws if citizens either don’t know about them 11/08/2020 09:09 AM or don’t care if they violate them — because there is no penalty. back to the free-range pets and the toll they take on our natural spaces, together with the flagrant violation of federal law where this applies to our shoreline. Either you care about our environment, or it goes to the dogs. Screen Name Redacted The Fire department has assisted us when caring for my mother in end of life 11/08/2020 11:39 AM care when she had to go to the hospital due to a serious life altering fall or other serious incident. They were well trained to take on the first response assistance that was greatly appreciated. Screen Name Redacted Divest the giant out of proportion police budget to real problems    11/08/2020 01:17 PM Screen Name Redacted I am not sure if we require more Police services, if we do then I suggest we Page 81 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire 11/08/2020 08:23 PM increase Screen Name Redacted Consider alternatives for medical assistance 11/09/2020 03:46 PM Screen Name Redacted #33 - Present enforcement is a COMPLETE joke! Check the file for 2314 Oak 11/09/2020 08:14 PM Bay Avenue where fraud is ongoing. Screen Name Redacted Would llike to see some reassignment of Fire Department Budget to support 11/11/2020 12:29 AM faster progress on Emergency Preparedness plans. Overall, Police and Fire are consuming too much of the overall staffing budget and other departmental initiatives are suffering as a result, especially Planning and Buidling, which needs a more senior staff to oversee some critical initiatives. Screen Name Redacted Unfortunately, there has been a large uptick in thefts and vandalism in the 11/11/2020 02:50 PM past year. I don’t know if it’s locals or the expanded homeless population in the CRD driving some of it. I receive the fan outs and I can’t believe the increase in crime in the last few years. It’s certainly not at a level you see in most cities, but it’s concerning. I have so much respect for the Oak Bay PD, they are respectful, and have excellent reponse time. Screen Name Redacted Bylaw enforcement may need to increase with AirBnB and other issues... I'm 11/11/2020 03:02 PM also hoping some more proactive enforcement to get derelict yards and houses cleaned up would be possible. Screen Name Redacted Please enforce parking around Carnarvon park more. When baseball and 11/11/2020 08:22 PM soccer seasons hit, we get blocked in daily, despite tow away signage. Screen Name Redacted OB Police and firefighters are doing a wonderful job! 11/12/2020 11:57 AM Screen Name Redacted Increase bylaw enforcement around keeping the sidewalks clear of 11/13/2020 01:41 PM overhanging and encroaching bushes and trees. Screen Name Redacted Municipal By Laws should also apply to Oak Bay which by conveniently 11/13/2020 04:21 PM excluding themselves allows the Elgin Dump to flaunt every norm of Health, Safety, pollution and noise 6 days a week severely impacting a large quantity of residents. Terrible planning, zero proactive work done to fix this massive issue and in fact working actively and spending large sums to take more garbage in an already overloaded site. It is morally wrong and a disgrace Screen Name Redacted Please maintain and police the Goldsmith parking lot more actively. We have 11/14/2020 11:25 AM campers parking for multiple days unchecked by police after hours, defecation, urination, car races, cookouts and kitchen waste, people having sex in their cars - my daughter and I have walked by them!- used condoms being tossed, and garbage dumping (propane tank, carpet, furniture, old fencing, large garbage bags, bottles and MANY takeout containers). As a Meadow Place resident with a gate I pick up garbage and rake leaves Page 82 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire constantly so that people won’t add to the mess. This helps somewhat. Because of the joint usage of this lot by SD61, Recreation:Oak Bay and the Public works staff, no one seems to take an active ownership. I’ve had regular interaction with the Vice principal at Oakbay highschool up to last Fall. Melanie Paas has done her best and been very supportive. We put up a new fence and this year, for the first time since 2005, students are not congregating at our fence!! (Possibly due to the Covid scheduling?) They are skateboarding in the parking lot, which we don’t mind. Since COVID when the Public works yard office shutdown I have to say, emailing Terry Johnson directly has been most effective! He has been very helpful! No one group appears to maintain the lot. I have to complain to make things happen. Would be great if these activities and this parking lot could be more proactively monitored and maintained. When we bought the house it was a grassy field! Screen Name Redacted Amalgamate police and fire services - maintain standards for number of 11/14/2020 11:39 AM responders per population but eliminate duplicate admin and management. Policy review (?)- If two fire trucks and several first responders are attending non emergency medical calls is this the best use of resources? Screen Name Redacted The biggest problem I see in the municipality besides infrastructure deficit is 11/14/2020 04:09 PM reckless speeding with little to no serious speed enforcement (meaning tickets consistently and routinely issued). When you have drivers routinely exceeding twice the posted speed limit in residential neighbourhoods, it is clear that there is an enforcement problem. Screen Name Redacted A little difficult to comment as once again I am new to the area. 11/15/2020 10:23 PM Screen Name Redacted There is no rationale for the level of expenditure on police and fire services in 11/16/2020 12:00 PM Oak Bay. While I appreciate the work individual police officers and fire fighters do, Oak Bay should enter into cost and service sharing agreements with neighboring municipalities. Major crimes should be dealt with by VPD, whereas any residual policing in Oak Bay should be oriented towards community policing. Funding should go into increased mental health supports, by-law monitoring where necessary (I observe large developers getting around by-laws most often, presumably legally, e.g. installing what are clearly secondary suites in large new builds), and increased services for at-risk residents. Screen Name Redacted Less is more... 11/16/2020 02:17 PM Screen Name Redacted Fire department response to medical calls is largely redundant to EMS 11/16/2020 05:43 PM service. Screen Name Redacted Substantial increase in burglaries and minor crime with COVID and homeless 11/16/2020 06:31 PM people and young drug users targeting Oak Bay homes and autos. Page 83 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire Screen Name Redacted Parking Regulation budget should be proportionate to reduction in vehicle 11/16/2020 08:28 PM use with the new economy/new norm Screen Name Redacted Enforce 30 km speed limit on Foul Bay Road, or give up and change the 11/17/2020 05:42 PM limit. Screen Name Redacted Do not approve developments that create more street parking. Or change 11/18/2020 04:33 PM parking bylaw that will add on-street parking Screen Name Redacted I favour fewer police departments across the region and would not object to 11/18/2020 06:35 PM OB being part of another municipality's police department. Gosh we are more or less already part of Saanich minus the executive police support. Merge. Put an extra couple of officers on the ground and reduce the number of chiefs. Screen Name Redacted Does Oak Bay really need its own police force? 11/18/2020 08:11 PM Screen Name Redacted Increase funding to permitting. Review delays are incredibly frustrating 11/18/2020 09:27 PM Screen Name Redacted In some of these areas, first responder medical assistance and fire services 11/19/2020 02:32 PM come to mind, there might be significant efficiencies in more actively co- operating with Saanich (not Victoria). Oak Bay might benefit from greater depth of expertise and specialization. Screen Name Redacted Bylaws are not laws. A municipality does not have to enforce its own bylaws. 11/19/2020 05:56 PM And Oak Bay staff know this. How about an appeal mechanism when a citizen believes a bylaw should be enforced? Screen Name Redacted I hope that the police will be more stringent about enforcing the law and 11/19/2020 07:40 PM fining motorists, bicyclists and pedestrians who flout it. Screen Name Redacted contracted animal control should only act on valid complaints and not patrol 11/19/2020 07:57 PM for potential infractions Screen Name Redacted I am deeply disappointed by actions of the OB police - especially on their 11/19/2020 08:08 PM twitter feed. I expect the officers to be held to a high standard and I don’t feel that I am seeing that. I also expect them to be progressive and think outside of the box. I want to see improvements to their actions before I would support any advancements to their funding. I think we are all better off if they are out on the street getting to know the community and kids and not delving into baseless arguments and becoming highly offending quickly. I expect high standards of them and I am saddened by their conduct of late. Screen Name Redacted Consider use of volunteers for Fire Dept like many other communities do 11/20/2020 02:51 PM (View Royal) at a reduced cost. More bylaw enforcement of parking issues. Page 84 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire Screen Name Redacted enforcement both for the homeless that seem to have moved onto Oak Bay 11/20/2020 03:50 PM Ave and for parking would be greatly appreciated. with densification locally I have noticed behaviours such as parking on the sidewalk repeatedly that go unchecked. this forces people to walk on grass boulevards and will ultimately cause damage as well as put the safety of elderly pedestrians at risk. regarding the homeless individual, while generally not presenting any challenge, on 3 occasions we have had to walk by him to access our street while he is having an aggressive argument with himself. this behaviour is intimidating and not knowing whether our safety is at risk we have detoured to another street to give him room. Again, we pay significant annual property taxes and I would hope this could be addressed. Screen Name Redacted Currently NO parking enforcement on weekends, except for the Police. Not 11/20/2020 07:21 PM acceptable. Screen Name Redacted There needs to be more patrols at night to make OAK Bay safer. Too may 11/20/2020 09:02 PM cars are being broken into. Screen Name Redacted My neighbour constantly breaks the bylaws. Complaints by the surrounding 11/21/2020 03:44 PM neighbours are ignored. We are expected to follow the rules by living here yet they have an illegal suite, park recreational vehicles in their front yard. Block access to driveways with commercial vehicles and dispatch employees from their house. The employees also maintain and work on the house and yard. Enforce the bylaws. I pay taxes for the officers wages to do the job. Screen Name Redacted Police and Fire are important to keep in oak bay, to support our community 11/21/2020 11:57 PM No to amalgamation! Screen Name Redacted Provincial government is responsible for first responder medical assistance. 11/22/2020 06:21 PM They need to be held to that. Screen Name Redacted Unpermitted secondary suites everywhere. Parking is never enforced multiple 11/22/2020 08:12 PM streets have so many cars on them due to tenants homeowners cant even park . Starting to look like Fernwood Iike certain areas . If you want to route yourself a a jewel enforce your rules Screen Name Redacted Consider defunding police and develop alternate bodies to respond to non- 11/25/2020 02:10 PM violent calls or mental health crisis calls. Many populations do not feel safe reaching out to the police for help. Screen Name Redacted A.C.A.B 11/25/2020 07:17 PM Screen Name Redacted You need to hire a better by-law enforcement officer. The one I dealt with a 11/28/2020 02:00 PM few years back was not at all useful. If you still have same one, do a review of his effectiveness. Screen Name Redacted Fire, police, and first responders should be amalgamated with the City of 11/28/2020 02:59 PM Victoria. 20,000 people do not justify separate overhead of independent Page 85 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire departments. Especially in light of the infrastructure deficit. Screen Name Redacted Police and Fire Department Employees are overpaid for the work they do, the 11/28/2020 05:40 PM levels of education they have and the issues they face in the community. Contract negotiations follow an unsustainable path. There should be a cap on % increases, not a matching of other police and fire services. Screen Name Redacted Increase fire department staff. Skeleton crew cannot respond without VFD 11/29/2020 01:42 PM assistance. Pay your own way. Screen Name Redacted Please maintain Oak Bay specific services. They are amazing 11/29/2020 02:39 PM Screen Name Redacted More bylaw officer hours, please, and access on weekends when incidents 11/29/2020 03:55 PM happen. Screen Name Redacted DEFUND THE POLICE. Hold officers accountable for their actions. This 11/29/2020 04:49 PM district should strive to be a part of the solution, not an accomplice to the problem. Screen Name Redacted Please enforce off leash bylaws. 11/29/2020 06:38 PM Screen Name Redacted No, unless they believe the numbers will go higher as the average age of 11/29/2020 07:25 PM residents increases Screen Name Redacted Oak Bay seems to be too small for its own police department. 11/29/2020 09:48 PM Screen Name Redacted Do we really need our own police force? 11/29/2020 09:50 PM Screen Name Redacted Too many drivers speeding, ignoring crosswalks, etc. Saw police speeding 11/29/2020 11:05 PM on 2 occasions - no lights or sirens Screen Name Redacted Reduce street parking. An Annual fee for residential street parking should be 11/30/2020 01:01 PM levied for use of public property. Screen Name Redacted The Bylaws enforcement needs to come with a minimum fine and a 11/30/2020 05:44 PM graduating scale to a maximum. The tax payers who are following the Bylaws are paying for the staff who are maintaining those Bylaws. Money talks. There are fines for speeding. The speeds are posted. The information is public. Noncompliance has a price. Does not or cannot the CRD as a cooperative agency be the Emergency Measures expert and communicator? If there is an emergency of significance, one coordinated effort covers many options/situations. Screen Name Redacted Re 36: increase public information on preparations and more encouragement Page 86 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire 11/30/2020 06:06 PM to individual household preparations. Screen Name Redacted 33: Employment of at least 2 bylaw officers, in addition to the parking 11/30/2020 07:20 PM commissionaire, is critical to bylaw enforcement. From what I see, complaints are discouraged by the multiple complaints policy regarding by-laws. Concerns of involved residents who come to council and the considerable efforts of staff and council to write and enact by-laws seem wasted if by-laws are not actively enforced by an Oak Bay employee. Screen Name Redacted Volunteer and complaint based services are least expensive overall 11/30/2020 11:18 PM Screen Name Redacted Ban gas-powered leaf blowers. I refer you to the City of Palm Springs, CA, 12/04/2020 11:02 AM which banned them successfully and they have need of leaf blowers more than OB. Electric ones work fine, pollute less and are quieter. Screen Name Redacted Increase police funding during provincial state of emergency & COVID 19 12/10/2020 01:42 PM response, maintain this level after to relieve stress on force members Screen Name Redacted We really need to integrate fire & police services in Oak Bay 12/10/2020 02:16 PM Screen Name Redacted Police do a great job in Oak Bay! Please take holistic, multi-service approach 12/10/2020 02:28 PM to parks, natural areas Screen Name Redacted under 33 "as per 2021 plan" was added 12/10/2020 03:15 PM Screen Name Redacted Parking is out of control on side streets off Oak Bay Road. 2 hour limit is not 12/10/2020 05:09 PM followed Screen Name Redacted Comment on #37: check out our street (Satellite) - frequently parking 12/10/2020 05:23 PM violations from vendors Screen Name Redacted Under # 33 "Enforce" was underlined 12/10/2020 05:31 PM Screen Name Redacted Quicker response to 911 fire calls, please! My apartment would have burned 12/10/2020 05:41 PM down if a tenant had not put out the fire herself, by the time the fire crew arrived - at least 7 minutes after the call & I only live a few blocks away from the fire station Screen Name Redacted The population of Oak Bay does not change. The core funding should be 12/10/2020 05:53 PM static and not increasing. Screen Name Redacted Paramedics should be first responders 12/10/2020 05:59 PM Page 87 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire Screen Name Redacted Maintaining our own Oak Bay Fire Department and Police Department are 12/15/2020 03:35 PM essential, in my opinion. They are an integral part of the "Oak Bay fabric". Screen Name Redacted Only 38 checked, comment added: How many calls for ambulance were 12/15/2020 03:58 PM responded to in 2019?

There are more now. We need progressive policies like Victoria has, where suites and garden cottages are allowed to flourish, to solve the housing crisis and allow people to age in place. Screen Name Redacted There are many Airbnb's in Oak Bay that are adding to the housing crisis. 11/03/2020 10:15 PM Perhaps having someone regularly check the site for listings and contacting the owners would be beneficial Screen Name Redacted The concept of "Heritage" is a pile of baloni and is impeding the natural 11/04/2020 12:00 PM evolution of the city of victoria/oak bay Screen Name Redacted Re the environment PLEASE outlaw wood burning stoves, furnaces and 11/05/2020 10:48 PM fireplaces. I presume all homes have access to natural gas judging from all the pavement damage I see. AND ease up on the anal retentive tree cutting restrictions. If it's on my property I own it and I should have a right to have a sunny backyard so I can grow vegetables and live with a hundred mile diet - after spending a few thousand dollars on a deer fencing of course and wondering how much that carbon foot footprint is worth. Screen Name Redacted What happened to the regulation to restrict. house size on a lot? Happy to 11/06/2020 07:27 AM see new homes and renovations but not oversized single family homes. Change regulations to allow more flexibility town houses. 4 plexes. etc. Screen Name Redacted Ban gas powered leaf blowers etc. Increase sidewalks and bike lanes to 11/06/2020 09:43 AM decrease car traffic Screen Name Redacted Please regulate vacation rentals as they limit the number of rental 11/06/2020 10:25 AM accommodation in our area. Renters make our community more diverse so that we can have many income brackets living here. Tourists do not add to our sense of community. Screen Name Redacted We need more housing diversity. I would like to see building permits issued 11/06/2020 04:52 PM for more multi family housing on arterial roads in oak bay. Screen Name Redacted Oak bay should develop an old growth protection policy. That is, the 11/06/2020 07:16 PM protection of larger trees with a big carbon capture factor should be preserved. Screen Name Redacted This one is so confusing to me. Some of the homes that have been built in 11/06/2020 08:23 PM the last couple of years are not in keeping with the area. Like in Vancouver back in the 80s and again in recent years, monster modern looking and somewhat generic homes being built next to beautifully old charm homes. Screen Name Redacted please consider some form of vacation rental permit. ie weekly in summer Page 94 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire 11/06/2020 10:00 PM and monthly minimums in winter. Screen Name Redacted A free market and small government are in the best interest of Oak Bay 11/06/2020 11:19 PM Residents Screen Name Redacted Let's preserve what we share. Nothing is more important. When it's gone, it's 11/07/2020 10:00 AM gone. Developers who buy properties unsuitable for their plans on the assumption that they will be accommodated should be shut out. Calculating, capital C. This council seems to be trying. Do NOT become Helps clones, please please. Screen Name Redacted Engage in a public discussion regarding vacation rentals. 11/07/2020 12:02 PM Screen Name Redacted We have major pressure from eslewhere to affect our lifestyle. Until we agree 11/07/2020 12:18 PM on changing, it needs to be protected Screen Name Redacted Requiring building permits for work done several decades ago should follow a 11/07/2020 02:32 PM streamlined process Screen Name Redacted not a big fan of regulation, but tearing down or shipping perfectly good 11/08/2020 09:09 AM houses elsewhere is environmentally unsound and amplifies the commodification of homes by encouraging over-sized and over-priced dwellings. Encourage the maintenance of good houses. Screen Name Redacted Do not want Air BnB in Oak Bay 11/08/2020 11:39 AM Screen Name Redacted get rid of gas blowers and garden maintenance equipment 11/08/2020 05:51 PM Screen Name Redacted More assistance is required to help with invasive plant removal in all parks. 11/08/2020 08:23 PM To help protect trees and the tree canopy in Oak Bay, there needs to be a bylaw protecting them, especially Garry Oak trees. To do this suggest a bylaw that requires ivy be removed from all trees on private property. The sale of all English Ivy be banned in Nurseries A Bylaw which is enforced that all hedges (Ivy, Cedar, Pivot, Box Hedge, Holly and others), not be allowed to encroach onto sidewalks Oak Bay has many narrow sidewalks, some hedges are growing 18" to 2' onto sidewalks, forcing pedestrians to walk on roads Screen Name Redacted 41. Would light pollution be included in this list. 11/09/2020 01:17 PM Screen Name Redacted # - 43. Again 2314 oak Bay Avenue, many agreed changes by new owner 11/09/2020 08:14 PM incomplete, permits issued based on these actions, bylaw enforcement a joke. Screen Name Redacted Please ban gas leaf blowers for both single family dwellings and multi-family Page 95 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire 11/10/2020 06:50 PM buildings (condos, townhouses, etc). Where I live, in a cluster of condos, I am forced to listen to these every day of the week ---- and it raises my blood pressure each time I hear them. Screen Name Redacted Oak Bay needs to prepare comprehensive regulatory and financial incentive 11/11/2020 12:29 AM framework to protect its heritage properties and landscapes. Time is of the essence, as it is disappearing before our eyes. Sames goes building regulation: we need a modern, comprehensive framework that is consistent with community values on climate change mitigation/GHG reduction and that favours (a) rapid identification of parcels and zones for multi- famly/duplex/triplex housing; conservation/renovation over demolition/disposal and maintaining natural topography/drainage over rock/earth/tree removal for single-family residential projects. Screen Name Redacted OMG this obsession with banning gas leaf blowers is getting ridiculous. 11/11/2020 02:50 PM Regulate the times they can be used, even restrict the days they can be used on, but I don’t think banning them is practical. If you do decide, are you going to buy back all the existing ones residents have? Sorry but this is a sore subject for me, I don’t like them, they smell, they are loud, but not having them costs | $, and I’d have to run a noisy electric blower 2x as long if not more as they are gutless. Screen Name Redacted Ban leaf blowers! Ban noise on Sundays and statutory holidays - it would be 11/11/2020 07:00 PM amazing to have a day per week to enjoy being outside without hearing construction and leaf blowers! There was tons of leaf blower noise on Remembrance Day - it was awful!! Screen Name Redacted Revenue for services should offset expenditures in this area. I am not sure 11/12/2020 11:57 AM that building permit fees are high enough. Screen Name Redacted Oak Bay must ban the use of all noisy garden maintenance equipment, such 11/13/2020 01:36 PM as blowers, gas trimmers, and gas mowers, whether they be operated by garden maintenance services or residents themselves. We have been forced indoors by the noise and fumes many, many times this past year. Intolerable and unnecessary! We should be allowed to enjoy our own backyard, a privilege for which we pay high taxes! Screen Name Redacted Point 41 - Seriously? Oak Bay themselves are the single biggest polluter in 11/13/2020 04:21 PM the Township (Massive noise, Air Quality being polluted, Storing Dangerous combustible materials right next to residences (Old Propane/Gas cylinders many are not fully empty, next to paint, batteries etc) accepting wet garbage whith who knows what in it right next to residents! Screen Name Redacted Decrease = amalgamate and streamline. OB doesn't have the resource/ 11/14/2020 11:39 AM staff, can't afford consultants/ advice etc to figure out best practices on increasingly complex issues. Again, given the size of the municipalities and Victoria's population it's absurd that so much regulation is different, for eg building code. Screen Name Redacted During Covid I would like to see an increase of business liscenses due to Page 96 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire 11/14/2020 01:03 PM having to work from home. Maybe a temporary Covid initiative? Screen Name Redacted Prohibition of Airbnb does nothing to increase housing affordability despite 11/14/2020 04:09 PM noise to the contrary and in a tourism-depending community like ours it is a missed business opportunity for members of our community. Screen Name Redacted More regulations needed to avoid builders tearing down small homes and 11/14/2020 04:34 PM building massive and unappealing homes that change the character of a neighbourhood. Screen Name Redacted Size of homes and amount of lights in new builds is transforming this 11/14/2020 09:40 PM community into a nameless suburb. Please create a culture that preserves all manner of old homes and protects the environment by regulating light pollution and etc. Screen Name Redacted I do find it difficult to comment as once again I am new here. I have called 11/15/2020 10:23 PM the municipality to determine various laws etc, I have been very pleased with the info provided and how quickly I did get a response. Screen Name Redacted The municipality should be doing far more to regulate and balance 11/16/2020 12:00 PM development in Oak Bay. Tearing down existing viable properties, often taking mature trees with them, and building huge single family houses with a footprint almost equivalent to the lot size is neither environmentally nor socially sustainable. It drives up house prices, reduces tree canopy and water absorption, increases overall greenhouse gas emissions, and further reduces the stock of affordable rental housing. As an Oak Bay resident I am ashamed to see Victoria bearing all of the brunt and costs of the housing and homelessness crisis in our city, while Oak Bay refuses to address over- development, affordability, or the need to build affordable housing. Screen Name Redacted The regulatory burden is too high which contributes to the cost of living. Oak 11/16/2020 02:17 PM Bay is the butt of many well-deserved barbs. Screen Name Redacted Oak Bay's heritage protection is very sadly deficient. 11/16/2020 05:43 PM Screen Name Redacted Rampant overdevelopment of Oak Bay properties continues without 11/16/2020 06:31 PM abatement. Developers appear to be setting the agenda for this Council. Screen Name Redacted increase business taxes in-line with other CRD Municipalities 11/18/2020 04:33 PM Screen Name Redacted I'm not particularly opposed to people Air BnB-ing out their home but perhaps 11/18/2020 06:35 PM with some regulation. i.e. it has to be your primary residence. Or you rent only on full month or more increments. I believe that other bylaws (noise, etc) cover other issues that may (or may not) come up with Air Bnbs Screen Name Redacted License AirBNB and use revenue for enforcement 11/18/2020 09:27 PM Page 97 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire Screen Name Redacted More enforcement 11/20/2020 02:51 PM Screen Name Redacted Regulating noise pollution should apply to the Oak Bay Municipal yard as well 11/20/2020 03:50 PM as residents. The amount of noise coming from the yard over an expanded work week has grown with recycling. Many days we hear trucks starting their engines, idling and back up alarms as early as 6:15 am. We also hear loud conversations between employees as they holler back and forth to each other over the noise of the machines. I would personally like to see a noise barrier erected from the Oak Bay Track and around the periphery up to where the already installed section is. There should not be preferential treatment of some residents over others particularly considering where much of the equipment is parked and the recycling takes place. Screen Name Redacted big developers should be paying higher fees to build in the municipality 11/20/2020 05:23 PM Screen Name Redacted You have to revise bylaws to limit the hours any builder can use hole 11/20/2020 09:02 PM ramming to excavate. We should not have to hole ramming every weekday from 8 - 4 for months on end. Hole ramming should not be allowed for more that two hours three days a week and only at set times, like maybe 9:30 to 11:30 in the AM. Otherwise we cannot enjoy our outdoor yards and community and we cannot even concentrate when working at home as the noise is disruptive unhealthy and disruptive. COVId has so many of us working at home and constrained to where we can go, even outdoors. One cannot even go for walks in the neighbourhood when hole ramming is happening. It is unhealthy to allow hole ramming every day all day for months on end. And the noise impacts neighbours way farther away than just 100 meters from the hole ramming. Screen Name Redacted no short-term rentals, ie AirBnB 11/20/2020 09:17 PM Screen Name Redacted The by laws need to be changed so that owners can update existing older 11/21/2020 12:15 PM homes. Too much interference on small changes that make it impossible to do any repairs or additions. Screen Name Redacted Again every house on our street has a suite not one is legal but nothing is 11/22/2020 08:12 PM done , but there is more of a concern over gas leaf blowers Screen Name Redacted There should be a heavy focus on native plants and ecosystems. Best way 11/24/2020 11:40 PM to encourage the health of the environment. Screen Name Redacted Too many of our heritage homes have already been ship out or torn down. 11/25/2020 10:10 AM Oak Bay promises to improve this, but it has increased exponentially in recent years. Why does Oak Bay support developers and penalize homeowners. I would like to see some big steps here to support home improvement over new builds! Is it already too late! Page 98 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire Screen Name Redacted Stop the outflow of heritage homes! Too many shipped out or torn down. 11/25/2020 10:31 AM Allow upgrades to existing homes over new development. Developers are given the green light without consideration of what could be done to preserve and improve existing housing. Stop penalizing and roadblocking heritage preservation. I feel Oak Bay has really let us down here. Screen Name Redacted Oak Bay needs to develop stronger heritage building protection policies and 11/26/2020 11:20 AM control building. Screen Name Redacted I wish we could ban noisy power tools (lawn mowers, etc.) after 5 pm on 11/28/2020 12:54 PM weekends in summer. Screen Name Redacted The heritage character of Oak Bay needs more protection. Ban gas powered 11/28/2020 02:00 PM leaf blowers. Screen Name Redacted Your question about Airbnb regulation is confusing. Fine Airbnb owners out of 11/28/2020 02:50 PM existence. Screen Name Redacted Change/fix the zoning issues so that people can't clear cut their lots to build 11/28/2020 05:40 PM stupid big houses. Just because you can, doesn't mean you should but, the district needs to step up on this and stop the destruction of the large mature tress that make Oak Bay great. Does anyone 'need' a 4000 sq ft. house? Screen Name Redacted A few things. Enforcement of business licenses seems to be hit or miss. A 11/28/2020 07:07 PM neighbour talked about the regulations of one business vehicle - if that's true, there's a house on Island running an environmental consulting firm with four vehicles sometimes on the property.....where is the consistency? While I'd like to see Oak Bay increase its heritage homes, especially by encouraging moderate density increases on such properties, the municipality has to have some stake in this as currently they aren't offering much in the way of incentives to keep our heritage - case in point in the Keith house which will be torn down on Island Road any day. The asks from Oak Bay were WAY over the top, given the value to the neighbourhood of maintaining that home and streetscape. If you're going to require all of these things from an HRA or subdivision, why not from monster homes replacing modest homes? It simply isn't fair and the result will be for people to choose the easier route and sell to developers. Ditto with trees - how are many of these new homes even able to have the appropriate tree canopy? and there should be more value placed on protecting the older trees. Screen Name Redacted For #43, Oak Bay needs to be less restrictive and less bureaucratic. I know 11/29/2020 10:49 AM of a proposed development that took over two years for a decision to be finalized. Less restrictions and faster decisions, when necessary, should be the priority. Screen Name Redacted OB cannot expand further. It needs to decrease its footprint. 11/29/2020 01:42 PM Page 99 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire Screen Name Redacted Please slow down the construction in South Oak Bay. It's too much noise, 11/29/2020 01:56 PM dirt, interruption, etc. The blasting, the ripped up boulevards that we have to repair at our own expense, and the constant blocking of streets, cut-off of hydro, etc is ridiculous. Screen Name Redacted This council needs to show greater leadership and direction to staff in 11/29/2020 02:41 PM protecting the heritage assets of our community, especially in the form of positive incentives to preserve and maintain historic homes. For example, property tax relief; non punitive use of HRA’s; and develop plans for the Heritage Foundation to grow their financial capacity to support heritage conservation. Screen Name Redacted Regulations needed on construction noise and disturbance. A “must be 11/29/2020 03:55 PM completed by date” clause with every building permit. Much, much more preservation of heritage homes. For example, if a builder uses a heritage revitalization application to come up with a plan then doesn’t agree with Council on their rulings, he cannot then demolish the home. Any building more than 80 years old should be looked at far more carefully before a demo permit is issued. Renovation and additions should be encouraged. You could stop the demolitions cold by insisting that the subsequent house must be built within the same footprint as the demolished one and would never get a permission to add to it in the future. But, if the existing building is preserved and sympathetic additions are designed, the permissions are issued speedily. A realistic fine for the flouting of rules. Building or demolishing without a valid permit? Everything must be put back as it was plus a fine of 10% of the property value. No blasting! Build to conform with the contours of the lot as they did more than 100 years ago. Screen Name Redacted It took far too long for council to finally pass the Heritage Conservation Area 11/29/2020 04:49 PM and as a result, irreplaceable community cultural heritage was destroyed. This should be used as a good learning lesson for future considerations. Screen Name Redacted Please develop policies to encourage affordable housing in Oak Bay and 11/29/2020 06:59 PM petition assistance from the CRD, the Province and the Government of Canada. Screen Name Redacted 1. Close most of the area used by our dump and tender out the collection 11/29/2020 07:25 PM and services. 2. Build a three store building for use of start up companies. This would provide income for the municipality. Could be part of UVIC and/or Camousen . Screen Name Redacted Resources devoted to maintaining Oak Bay's heritage has to be sufficient to 11/29/2020 09:48 PM prevent the city losing its character. Screen Name Redacted #42 - it’s important to keep the streetscape when applications for new 11/29/2020 09:50 PM buildings are considered. Screen Name Redacted RE 43. Regulate demolition of older homes. Regulate size of new building 11/30/2020 01:01 PM footprint to minimize blasting area and depth. Prevent loss of tree canopy by limiting tree removal for new builds. Designs should conform to topography Page 100 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire and landscape, rather than changing topography and landscape to suit design. Screen Name Redacted Blasting and drilling has been a nightmare this summer. Sorry. Very little 11/30/2020 02:21 PM consideration given to surrounding homes. Including very early morning drilling and noise. Screen Name Redacted Home owners are home owners. How they live is their choice. When their 11/30/2020 05:44 PM choice creates another problem, that problem needs to be addressed - noise bylaws, illegal parking, etc.. Does Oak Bay have a set percentage of any residential lot being identified as maximum building size? Screen Name Redacted By-laws re building permits and vacation rentals obviously not enforced; and 11/30/2020 06:06 PM latter SHOULD NOT require neighbours to bring infringement to attention of city. Building permit rules must be better publicized. Screen Name Redacted 40 & 44: If Oak Bay wishes to have secondary suites as part of the district's 11/30/2020 07:20 PM legal housing options, vacation rentals should be licensed and taxed at a rate that would actually discourage short term accommodation and encourage long term occupancy of these spaces. Currently, "illegal" vacation rentals/air bnb's thrive because of the services -- parks, beaches, tree canopy, street parking, garbage removal, etc -- provided by taxes paid to Oak Bay without any increase for the additional demands of residences that are vacation accommodations (or have secondary suites). Screen Name Redacted please keep Airbnb out of oak bay 11/30/2020 11:18 PM Screen Name Redacted So much noise this year from construction, blasting, drilling, etc. When you 12/04/2020 11:02 AM grant permission for this, can you do so based on a finite amount of noise from the company, then communicate that to the neighbours so there is a defined end to the inconvenience caused. Then, big fines to company if noise goes on longer. Also no loud music on construction sites. Screen Name Redacted Heritage is only a façade as buildings must be brought to current building 12/10/2020 01:42 PM codes. Should be done with more onus to owners. Screen Name Redacted Vacation rentals are not bad operations & using business licenses as 12/10/2020 02:01 PM enforcement method works efficiently. Look at Salt Spring Island (where STVR are banned but many are underground) - don't make them go "underground" in Oak Bay, but legally available Screen Name Redacted continue to disallow Airbnb's #44 - other municipalities are much faster than 12/10/2020 02:22 PM 3 weeks Screen Name Redacted #42 - stop monster homes 12/10/2020 02:28 PM Screen Name Redacted under 41 " and expand scope of the proactive environmental protection" was 12/10/2020 03:15 PM added Page 101 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire Screen Name Redacted Why does Oak Bay not allow vacation rentals? 12/10/2020 05:31 PM Screen Name Redacted If an inspection takes ????longer big deal. Don't worry there will be little new 12/10/2020 05:53 PM businesses in OB. Screen Name Redacted Vacation rentals should continue to be regulated in accordance with bylaws. 12/15/2020 03:35 PM This is an area for potential review by Council. Building & development permits should include appropriate road & sidewalk maintenance, repair and construction costs. Construction vehicles are causing significant damage. Ant-noise bylaws should be extended to loud mufflers in motorcycles, cars and trucks. Screen Name Redacted 40 - important, continue this policy 41 - illegible 42 - effort to maintain "feeling 12/15/2020 03:52 PM & appearance" of Oak Bay while making improvements 44 - The municipality has maintained and improved the village area of Oak Bay, especially during COVID.

Eg. 11/02/2020 09:26 PM Richardson/McNeill Ave. Oak Bay is not an Island. Screen Name Redacted Many sidewalks on busy arterial roads are inadequate width. North 11/02/2020 10:02 PM Henderson Rd., Oak Bay Ave., compromise safety when pedestirna have to pass each other by stepping into the traffic. Over 3,000 people signed a petition to fix North Henderson Rd. sidewalks over 12 years ago, yet no work has been done to address this hazard. Likewise many parts of Oak Bay Ave. around the villages. Screen Name Redacted Don’t give subsidies to people with electric vehicles by incurring charging 11/03/2020 02:05 AM costs. Screen Name Redacted Dedicated lanes are needed for more than just bikes. They would be used by 11/03/2020 11:12 AM scooter mobility aids as well. Road space for these forms of transportation, well away from the danger of opening car doors, has long been an important safety issue in Oak Bay. Compared to other municipalities, our facilities in this regard are an embarrassment. Screen Name Redacted Sidewalks are incredibly dangerous in Oak Bay during the winter. The 11/03/2020 10:15 PM sidewalks are scarier than the roads! The municipality should be deicing all main roads and the high traffic sidewalks to avoid accidents and long term injuries. Screen Name Redacted Protected bike lanes are a must, and studies show "painted bike lanes" are 11/04/2020 12:00 PM even more dangerous than not having one at all. There is no such thing as a "painted" bike lane. Screen Name Redacted The mess created for roads, traffic, and parking from the current cycling 11/04/2020 03:41 PM injection has never been addressed or remedies. Get a traffic light on haultain and turning lights on bee, fort and fb. Screen Name Redacted Q50 - we shouldn't pay for residents to recharge their cars Q51 - cycling is a 11/04/2020 04:26 PM challenge on main roads in this community Screen Name Redacted More dedicated bike lanes are needed that feed into the greater Victoria 11/05/2020 10:11 PM system. I believe more EV stations will be needed in the future. I also believe that users should pay for charging. Page 109 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire Screen Name Redacted People should pay for the electricity for electric vehicles. 11/05/2020 10:48 PM Screen Name Redacted As you can see downtown Victoria or other cities where there is dedicated 11/06/2020 07:27 AM bike paths for cyclists they will feel comfortable to use. Important. gets kids out cycling and more families. Screen Name Redacted parked cars is a hazard for bikers - please create safe bike routes / lanes 11/06/2020 09:43 AM especially around schools. Screen Name Redacted Most egregious traffic issue in Oak Bay is the 50km speed limit and lack of 11/06/2020 10:08 AM traffic calming on Musgrave st. There is an elementary school on this street! and an urban village, excellent active transportation opportunities, and cars regularly diving over 60km per hour. The street needs traffic calming Screen Name Redacted more focus on cycling paths as so much more people are now on bikes. Plus 11/06/2020 10:25 AM if we can have a safe routes into the heart of our community like Oak Bay ave, we can attract other residents from other municaplities to shop here. Screen Name Redacted The EV charging stations should be increased at cattle point boat launch, 11/06/2020 07:16 PM turkey head and other locations. Level 3/2 EV charging stations should be available, but on a user-pay system , slightly subsidized and NOT for free. Screen Name Redacted Please consider increasing snow removal bylaws. Too many sidewalks are 11/06/2020 10:00 PM not cleared safely especially on arterial roads such as Henderson. I called on a few occasions over the last 2 snowfalls and was told no enforcement available. Whats the point of a bylaw if you dont respond to citizen concerns? Henderson bike lanes are fine as is. Please dont cave in to the noisy minority. Its a good balance as it is. But you could consider removing that stupid 30 zone outside of the former Uplands School... Screen Name Redacted You could charge a small amount for the use of your charger, just so it is 11/06/2020 10:17 PM cost neutral to operate. Cost recovery seems reasonable. Screen Name Redacted The sidewalks leading into the village on oak bay avenue from around Elgin 11/06/2020 10:53 PM road is very narrow and hard to navigate for people in mobility scooters or wheelchairs. Please look into widening. Screen Name Redacted Ensure that all road building and maintenance contracts are properly 11/06/2020 11:19 PM tendered, allowing all qualified parties to quote. Screen Name Redacted I walk, drive, cycle, and take transit to work. I support cycling for anyone who 11/07/2020 10:00 AM wants, but there MUST BE REGULATION. Cyclists must know and follow traffic rules, for wheeled traffic. It's madness out there, and dedicated cycle paths of varying types seem to cement the idea that anything goes if you are on a bike... Screen Name Redacted Maintain status quo with roads. Avoid inefficient traffic calming. 11/07/2020 12:02 PM Page 110 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire Screen Name Redacted Provide for the future 11/07/2020 12:18 PM Screen Name Redacted The flashing stop sign at Hampshire Rd. and Oak Bay Ave. seems like a 11/07/2020 12:58 PM waste of money? Screen Name Redacted The municipality should not be spending any funds on charging electric 11/07/2020 03:23 PM vehicles. | $2666 can be spent on infrastructure priorities. Cyclists are vehicles and do not require special lanes and should adhere to traffic regulations such as stopping at lights, not wearing helmets and no hand signals when turning - they need to be fined. Screen Name Redacted Despite the low cost to the community, EV charging at taxpayer expense is 11/07/2020 03:37 PM unwarranted as a matter of principle - these vehicle owners (mostly wealthy people who can afford these vehicles) already get a substantial taxpayer subsidy due to not paying gas tax. Screen Name Redacted encourage walking, bikes, and good, clean, safe public transit. Decrease the 11/08/2020 09:09 AM need to drive. Screen Name Redacted 1 - for new areas sidewalks are really only needed on one side of the street 11/08/2020 11:39 AM 2 - Oak bay is lovely for cycling and we definitely do not need to confuse the situation with additional bike lanes. There is ample ability as a biker to work with what we have at the moment. Screen Name Redacted Oak bay side walks are not accessible at all, with a large elderly population 11/08/2020 01:17 PM it’s irresponsible. As a business owner I am the only one who is shovelling on snowy days, not a city worker to be seen. They apparently get snow days, where I get yelled at for not shovelling every 5 minutes while it’s actively snowing. Screen Name Redacted more sidewalk repair, less dedicated cycling lanes which lead to impossibility 11/08/2020 05:51 PM of widening sidewalks Screen Name Redacted If anything the municipality has to develop safe cycling routes around oak bay 11/08/2020 08:42 PM for student cycling (elementary, middle, and high school). Screen Name Redacted Do not give cyclists separate lanes ! I can easily see a cyclist on the road in 11/08/2020 10:18 PM Oak Bay. When I drive in Victoria I can not see the cyclists behind parked cars - I prefer to see and keep an eye on the skill level of the cyclist so I can be prepared to react if need be. The cyclists in Victoria could be doing donuts beside me and I would not see them. Let's never become Victoria and hide the cyclists from the cars. Screen Name Redacted 50. Will likely need more charging stations as rules change about gas 11/09/2020 01:17 PM vehicles. Currently, we have more space on Oak Bay ave due to Covid spacing requirements- could we maintain that extra walking lane (on the road)permanently? Page 111 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire Screen Name Redacted District should recover costs for EV stations 11/09/2020 03:46 PM Screen Name Redacted #48 - Traffic signals at Oak Bay Ave. and Monterey should be adjusted. 11/09/2020 08:14 PM Pedestrians only manage two paces before warning hand comes on. Have been yelled at over this. Efforts to have changes made ignored, nil response from staff. Screen Name Redacted I have never understood why the people who can afford to buy electric 11/10/2020 06:50 PM vehicles are given free charging privileges. You won't not buy an electric vehicle simply because you may have to pay a few dollars to charge it. Please start charging for this service. Screen Name Redacted Some sidewalks near the Oak Bay Village are not wide enough for two 11/10/2020 11:40 PM strollers (or two seniors with walkers) to pass. Screen Name Redacted Pleased to see work done to ramp all curbs at intersections. Now need to 11/11/2020 12:29 AM redirect funds from road re-paving to sidewalk expansion in Oak Bay Village from St. Patrick Street to Foul Bay - so that at least 3 people walking abreast can share space safely; make Bowker Creek walkway safe and accessible to all users (cyclists/pedestrians/mobility-impaired) - a project that has been talked about for years and nothing done! Proper bike lanes connecting with Saanich and Victoria bikelanes; a 5-fold increase in bicycle parking in Oak Bay Village. Screen Name Redacted Owners of EVs should pay for charging, not the municipality. Single bike 11/11/2020 09:44 AM lanes should be provided on busy streets. I do not feel we need extensive double bike lanes as in victoria at this time. Screen Name Redacted Please don’t go the way of Victoria and put in so many bike lanes! 11/11/2020 10:01 AM Screen Name Redacted Is ice and snow even a problem here except for a few days?? I’m a cyclist 11/11/2020 02:50 PM and I find biking though Oak Bay is not an issue. I do use the cadboro bike lane and it’s fine as is, I don ‘t see the value in putting in those expensive physically separated lanes Victoria has put in. I also find I often just use the side streets to make my way around, I just avoid the major routes. Screen Name Redacted (1) Curb drops: these should be accelerated. If people in wheelchairs or 11/11/2020 03:02 PM pushing prams can't cross the streets you are not providing the basics for active transportation. (2) EV Stations: more would be great, but these can be commercial units. The municipality should not be subsidizing charging unless the businesses wish to do so to attract business. (3) I can see a few obvious places to provide cycling lanes (Cadboro Bay Rd and McNeil come to mind), but Oak Bay is a cycling heaven for the most part - quiet streets, low traffic volumes, and a culture of courtesy. Screen Name Redacted Irresponsible cyclists and vehicle drivers not stopping at the flashing stop 11/12/2020 09:46 AM sign at the Beach Drive and Cadboro Bay Road intersection are a major problem. Oak Bay police need to educate the cycling public by issuing Page 112 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire violation tickets to both cyclists and vehicle drivers at this very dangerous intersection. Screen Name Redacted Please consider charging at the EV charging station as it costs everyone for 11/12/2020 11:57 AM a select few. Screen Name Redacted #50 Owners of electric vehicles should pay for their own charging. #52 The 11/13/2020 01:36 PM congestion on Cadboro Bay at Foul Bay and at Bee Street in both directions is the result of imperfect planning to accommodate cycle lanes. The situation is ludicrous and potentially dangerous. We have seen numerous instances of drivers veering out of lane to try to avoid line-ups, then speeding up to get back in to the right lane. Please, no more bike lanes until this situation is remedied and better planning for future bike lanes can be in place. Screen Name Redacted I would like to see a public washroom along Beach Dr. at the McNeill Bay 11/13/2020 01:41 PM area. Screen Name Redacted Owners of electric vehicles should include planning for recharging as their 11/14/2020 08:56 AM own responsibility and expense. Screen Name Redacted Road safety infrastructure is also underinvested, especially around schools. 11/14/2020 11:39 AM Round abouts, speed bumps, signalled pedestrian crossings, electronic speed monitoring, reflective paint/road markings. Screen Name Redacted Foul Bay Road needs sidewalks on both sides of the road, as Victoria has 11/14/2020 04:09 PM done. Screen Name Redacted In response to question 50: Many people cannot afford an electric vehicle. 11/14/2020 06:04 PM Those who can afford one can probably afford the energy cost of charging their vehicle. Screen Name Redacted EV charging should be handled by EV owners, especially given incentives 11/15/2020 01:40 PM available to private owners. Oak Bay could be a very walkable city! Sometimes I think it’s sidewalks should be twice as wide. I see people with mobility aids or strollers really struggling to get rains crowds. Bike lanes would also be very nice and I fully support them. Generations of future residents will benefit from investments here. Screen Name Redacted I do love cycling so would love to see more more cycling lanes, thanks!! I 11/15/2020 10:23 PM would live to see more electric vehicles so assume may be need for more charging stations Screen Name Redacted Better cycling infrastructure is particularly needed on school routes (e.g. to 11/16/2020 12:00 PM Monterey, OBH and Willows Schools). Screen Name Redacted Bike lanes are expensive and not really that necessary all types of people 11/16/2020 12:24 PM using the roads need to pay attention to the rules Bicycles tend to ignore most or all stop signs on Oak Bay and there is no enforcement, awhile ago I actually witnessed several bikes run the stop sign at the bottom of King Page 113 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire George Terrace at Beach Dr (that's normal I've seldom seen a bike stop there ) in this instance there was An Oak Bay police car stopped at the sign (yes there was an officer in it at the time) and they just went around him through the stop and he ignored them, If I'd done that in a car ? I'd get a ticket ! at the time I was walking .. so how about a little enforcement or education of he public . Screen Name Redacted All nice to have's, but not required during this economic cycle. 11/16/2020 02:17 PM Screen Name Redacted Infrastructure needs to be enhanced significantly for safe use by pedestrians 11/16/2020 05:43 PM and cyclists. Temporary safety measures for pedestrians in the Village area need to be enhanced and made permanent. Screen Name Redacted Victoria has developed bike lanes at tremendous cost that are basically used 11/16/2020 06:31 PM in rush hour and impede auto traffic the rest of the time. Oak Bay can use its scarce resources more wisely. Screen Name Redacted Close some roads to vehicle traffic, to create walking / cycling options; as 11/16/2020 08:28 PM well as opportunities to invest in Oak Bay. Example is to further expand businesses operating on Oak Bay avenue (on the road) and to divert traffic through the core of the village (road options are available on both sides). Screen Name Redacted Excellent sidewalk and road management. Could be improved by providing 11/17/2020 05:42 PM more dedicated bike lanes. Screen Name Redacted Safer, physically separated bike lanes on school routes are needed for young 11/17/2020 09:07 PM students of Willows, Monterey, GNS. Please make safe active transportation options a priority. Screen Name Redacted We need safer bike routes for kids now! McNeill 11/17/2020 09:51 PM Screen Name Redacted PLEASE focus on active transportation. It will improve liveability, health 11/18/2020 04:47 PM outcomes, safety, community engagement, economic growth, access to services etc etc Oak Bay is becoming a laggard when it should be a leader. Apply to the Provincial Active Transportation Grant Program. Focus on key corridors like Cadboro Bay Road between Willows elementary and OB High and from OB High to Monterey Middle school. Screen Name Redacted Walkability and cycling is one of the primary ways to give a municipality a 11/18/2020 06:35 PM community/neighborly feel. This can't be emphasized enough. And a question, why is it that the municipality is the last to shovel its street front if we get a random weekend snow storm? That's just wrong. Hardly a signal for the rest of us to get out their shovelling. Screen Name Redacted I like the changes to Oak Bay Ave to widen the walking areas and narrow the 11/18/2020 08:11 PM road. I am constantly surprised how many streets in Oak Bay lack sidewalks altogether. This is so dangerous! Screen Name Redacted My question. Is the apparent current policy of repeatedly patching sidewalks Page 114 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire 11/19/2020 02:32 PM that are failing more or less expensive than setting out a program of replacing long stretches of deteriorating sidewalks? My hunch is that the latter might be better, but has it been looked into? Screen Name Redacted People who use public charging stations for electric vehicles should have to 11/19/2020 07:40 PM pay for doing so, just as people who drive cars have to pay for gasoline. Screen Name Redacted the new curb cuts are excellent; not sure if more sidewalks are needed 11/19/2020 07:57 PM Screen Name Redacted I want to see the municipality make it safer for us to bike. We like to shop 11/19/2020 08:08 PM local and use our bikes and walking for that. We need the municipality to help promote biking in a safe way with lanes designated. I would like to see a designated bike lane on Hampshire so the kids can get to and from school safely. I want to see the Victoria bike lanes extended into Oak Bay. Screen Name Redacted People should be charged for charger use. I pay taxes on my gasoline 11/20/2020 01:00 PM purchases to maintain roads so EV users should pay for this service to maintain roads they also use. Oak Bay is a safe place to ride with the exception of Beach Drive and parts of Oak Bay Avenue. There are plenty of quiet, wide roads and laneways to ride on in OB. Screen Name Redacted Bike lines can be made at a reduced cost by using curbing such as that used 11/20/2020 02:51 PM on Cadboro Bay in Saanich. It creates physical barrier but without all the expensive bells and whistles, and time, that Victoria required. During the one major snow event, only major arteries should be cleared. Reduce costs as people mainly stay home anyway. As long as emergency services can get nearby. Screen Name Redacted work with bc transit to identify pinch points where buses can't traverse 11/20/2020 03:00 PM because of parking on the street Screen Name Redacted add more charging stations and charge for the electricity similar to parking 11/20/2020 03:21 PM Screen Name Redacted The sidewalks in Oak Bay, like the roads, are in bad repair and getting 11/20/2020 03:41 PM worse. They pose safety hazards for anyone not fully stable on their feet, such as seniors. It's embarrassing. Screen Name Redacted Electric vehicle charging stations are a subsidy for a high cost product. 11/20/2020 03:49 PM Screen Name Redacted snow removal should happen on all streets within a reasonable timeframe. 11/20/2020 03:50 PM We often do not see any snow removal in a heavy (for Victoria) fall for sometimes upwards of 7 days. This likely will be more critical as our new neighbour is an ER physician and his inability to get out of his driveway could have broader ramifications in such a scenario. Screen Name Redacted Our sidewalks and small roads are the worst in the CRD. We have had poor Page 115 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire 11/20/2020 05:23 PM response from the district on this safety issue - emails unanswered on several occasions. You suggest in this survey that complaints lead to repairs within three months when in fact, they lead to spray painted caution lines that weather out before 3 months have passed. We need to do a better job here to keep pedestrians and cyclists safe. Screen Name Redacted Don't build expensive bike lanes that very few people use! 11/20/2020 07:21 PM Screen Name Redacted You really need a 4 way stop at Windsor and Newport. It is so dangerous for 11/20/2020 09:02 PM bicycles trying to turn at that intersection. Card comes down the hill to fast and cut corners as the zoom off to Beach Drive on Windsor. You need to ensure no big cars park too near the intersection and block the view of oncoming cars. A huge Shaw truck usually parks so as to block the view of cars coming along Newport from the south. Also ban gas powered leaf blowers now. Screen Name Redacted Allow private vehicle charging stations. consider implementing a charge for 11/20/2020 09:17 PM use of the Municipal Hall charging station in the near future. Great to subsidize e vehicles now but stop the subsidy next year. Screen Name Redacted Bike lanes and no bikes. Waste of money and extremely hazardous for bus 11/21/2020 03:44 PM traffic and crossing pedestrians. Screen Name Redacted Painted lines for bikes are fine if anything. NO bike lanes like Victoria 11/21/2020 05:16 PM please!!! Screen Name Redacted We are a small community- people can charge their cars at home. Cycle 11/21/2020 11:57 PM ways are not worth the | $to build in our residential community- we aren’t that urban! Cars (and do!) can share the road. Don’t spend millions like Victoria has- it is such a waste! Screen Name Redacted See my comments about sidewalks in the previous section. Sidewalks are a 11/22/2020 12:06 PM disgrace and need URGENT attention. We need flat, smooth, two-person+ wide sidewalks everywhere in Oak Bay. Please walk with someone who uses a mobility aid to assess the magnitude of the problem. Oak Bay is NOT SAFE for walking. Screen Name Redacted On roads with two sidewalks just turn one side into bike only 11/22/2020 12:08 PM Screen Name Redacted EV charging does not need to be a municipal service. The District doesn't 11/22/2020 06:21 PM have free gas pumps. Screen Name Redacted Public works is non existant . Repair your out dated failing infrastructure 11/22/2020 08:12 PM Screen Name Redacted Enough with the cycling lanes. Ridiculous. 11/23/2020 07:49 PM Page 116 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire Screen Name Redacted A lot of sidewalks need attention--a lot of dips, weeds growing on them, 11/23/2020 09:39 PM cracks, etc. Unacceptable for a premiere municipality such as Oak Bay. Screen Name Redacted The number 1 priority should be to integrate with the Victoria cycling network 11/23/2020 09:43 PM by making matching investments into equally safe, high quality, physically protected, dedicated bike lanes. Bike lane investments must not stop at the Victoria border, but continue uninterrupted across oak bay, including Richardson, Pandora-fort, haultain and uvic connections. The health, environmental and transportation network benefits make it a win win win, and the opportunity with Victoria’s investments means the time is now. Screen Name Redacted Make Oak Bay Ave more pedestrian friendly and get rid of cars or at the very 11/24/2020 08:44 PM least parking on the Avenue Screen Name Redacted I would discourage the implementation of bike lanes along Oak Bay Ave. We 11/25/2020 10:10 AM love to bike, but Oak Bay Ave is not a problem needing to be fixed. Screen Name Redacted We are avid cyclists and are against building bike lanes on Oak Bay Ave. 11/25/2020 10:31 AM Bike lanes are not always the answer and create new problems. The current situation isn't perfect, but it is not a problem either. Screen Name Redacted There is no need for any more bike lanes. The walk signals that made 11/28/2020 02:00 PM automatic at some intersections because of the pandemic, should be left that way after the pandemic. Screen Name Redacted Cycling through Oak Bay is becomes more difficult as on-street parking 11/28/2020 02:50 PM increases. Screen Name Redacted I support more EV charging stations but on a pay-for-use basis. Cyclists 11/28/2020 02:59 PM should not be permitted on arterial roads without being licensed. The street lighting is too poor to properly see cyclists at night and a shocking number of cyclists do not have lights on their bikes. Screen Name Redacted Cycling infrastructure is poor in OB. Road design is needed to impede the 11/28/2020 05:40 PM speed of cars and trucks. Road narrowing and other measures are needed to make our community less dangerous. Screen Name Redacted Why shouldn't people charging their vehicles pay to do so? The rest of us 11/28/2020 07:07 PM have to pay for gas. Maybe the rules regarding snow removal on residential sidewalks should either be altered or enforced. As with most things in Oak Bay, it is complaint-driven and I've never heard of anyone fined for not removing the snow on their sidewalk frontage and yet the more conscientious amongst us do this diligently. Ditto with leaf removal - many people still put it on the street, which results in blocked drains and difficulty for pedestrians and cyclists. Screen Name Redacted At a cost of just under | $2700 and with an increase in the number of EVs, 11/29/2020 10:49 AM additional charging stations would be a very cost effective method of Page 117 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire promoting more people to go green. Screen Name Redacted Please fight the Richardson bike lane idea from the City of Victoria. The 11/29/2020 01:56 PM impact on traffic and the inconvenience for Oak Bay residents who work downtown is going to be negative. It's not going to incentivize me to bike to work. To make things accessible to everyone including those unable to bike, we need to thing regionally and be flexible. I love the cycling infrastructure, but let's be thoughtful about it. Let's not fix a problem that doesn't exist. There's no need for cycling system along Richardson like what's been proposed. Screen Name Redacted As mentioned, consider using existing light posts for EV charging More bike 11/29/2020 02:39 PM lanes would be great. Anything that keeps bikes safely away from vehicle traffic is good Screen Name Redacted I support cycling infrastructure. I do cycle in Oak Bay and what we have now 11/29/2020 06:38 PM seems sufficient, but I would be happy if we made more cycling lanes to improve safety for our young ones. Screen Name Redacted I support the addition of more bike lanes, however, not if they are disruptive 11/29/2020 06:59 PM to other modes of transportation. I would also like to see better signage and crosswalks, specifically, no more flashing stop signs like the one at Hampshire and the Avenue or the recent addition of poles at either end of the crosswalk in front of Fairways which truthfully are distracting in the day and worse than useless at night as they block people from view. Build small, low walls there and install lights instead. Screen Name Redacted No 11/29/2020 07:25 PM Screen Name Redacted We should be charging for EV charging. 11/29/2020 09:21 PM Screen Name Redacted More curb drops required on sidewalks to support those with mobility issues 11/29/2020 10:32 PM (walkers etc) and caregivers with strollers. Screen Name Redacted 51. Road space dedicated to cycling should be painted lines rather than 11/30/2020 01:01 PM lanes with permanent barriers. Limit street parking on dedicated cycling roads to prevent dooming accidents. e.g. McNeill. Monterey, Hampshire,Victoria Screen Name Redacted Implement the Active Transportation Plan 11/30/2020 03:08 PM Screen Name Redacted Decrease the recharging for FREE! Why are tax payers paying for some 11/30/2020 05:44 PM else's choice of vehicle?!? There needs to be a flat rate for charging. These people, like every vehicle owner needs to pay for their own running costs. ALL of B.C. needs to start charging for electric charging stations. It is not the poor or needy who are buying these vehicles! I did not agree to give my tax dollars to support some else's choice of vehicle. AND, cyclists do not need Page 118 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire more road ways! They do not contribute to the costs of building those road ways. Why are the cyclists not licensed like vehicle s? A yearly license fee would support some of thise lane ways. Ironic is it not that cars and trucks are building those cycling lanes. Stop building those cycling lanes infront of businesses. Acess lanes can be on side streets, less traffic too! Cyclists can walk their bikes across main streets using cross walks.bVictoria business owners have seen a significant drop in business before Covid. Businesses and services are the back bone of our economy and community health! Screen Name Redacted Make cycling safe and people will use: ‘build and they will come’. Make 11/30/2020 06:06 PM connections with work in Saanich and Victoria. Screen Name Redacted 50: Electric charging stations -- increase by providing level 3 fast charging 11/30/2020 07:20 PM station and consider having users pay. 51: I encourage the development of more safe cycling lanes with an overall plan for the district of Oak Bay, not a piece by piece approach. There are problems with the current lanes for cyclists and vehicle traffic at the intersection of Florence and Cadboro Bay Road. Screen Name Redacted Please encourage electric cars and maybe solar too 11/30/2020 11:18 PM Screen Name Redacted So many "road closed" signs in OB this year. Try to coordinate schedule and 12/04/2020 11:02 AM duration so the roads are maximally passable. They should not be staging areas for private construction companies. I am not aware of many accommodations in OB for cyclists. Extra space dedicated to pedestrians, restaurants, crosswalks, etc. actually make cycling more difficult and potentially dangerous. Screen Name Redacted May require additional funds for snow removal as the upcoming winter will be 12/10/2020 01:42 PM cold! Charge a user fee per time limit to recover costs as some conflicts between different users and some use the space as free parking. The costs should at least be recovered as double parking meter rates & to at least recover electrical costs and more enforcement and maintenance. Screen Name Redacted There is an EV charging station at OBHS as well and possibly others in Oak 12/10/2020 01:48 PM Bay Screen Name Redacted I think an advance green light at Foul Bay & Cadboro Bay Road intersection , 12/10/2020 02:01 PM for traffic facing north, would help traffic turning left. More staff reserves to increase heritage registry. Screen Name Redacted Roads, sidewalks are terrible and need urgent attention - replacement not 12/10/2020 02:10 PM patchwork repairs Screen Name Redacted Need to charge users for charging EV's at City Hall and elsewhere. We do 12/10/2020 02:16 PM NOT need more space dedicated to cyclists. Screen Name Redacted #50 - 5 or 6 more locations Page 119 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire 12/10/2020 02:22 PM Screen Name Redacted 46 - they need to be wide/all ages + abilities 47 - many are substandard - eg 12/10/2020 02:28 PM pole in middle of sidewalk - Bowker/Cadboro 51 - please! Join the 21st century. There is not a single meter of safe, separated bike land in Oak Bay Screen Name Redacted Comment on #48: Instead of speed max signs, put up more deer crossing 12/10/2020 02:44 PM signs Screen Name Redacted Richardson should remain a two-way street 12/10/2020 02:59 PM Screen Name Redacted Boo!! Don't need more stupid bike lanes! 12/10/2020 05:18 PM Screen Name Redacted Shelbourne Street (realize not in Oak Bay) really unsafe 12/10/2020 05:23 PM Screen Name Redacted Comment for # 50 & 51 "climate change!" 12/10/2020 05:31 PM Screen Name Redacted Start charging for power at EV charging stations. I am a cyclist, only Oak Bay 12/10/2020 05:53 PM Ave is a no go zone, that's fine. Screen Name Redacted EV owners should pay for their own charging facilities and energy use. The 12/15/2020 03:35 PM construction of additional bike lanes at significant cost should not be considered. Dedicated road space for bicycles should required bike users to pay for licenses. The speed limit on key roads in Oak Bay could be lowered in order to facilitate safe biking. Screen Name Redacted #50 - should be done by private enterprise 12/15/2020 03:43 PM Screen Name Redacted 46 - do we have to have sloped sidewalk where drivers cross the sidewalk? 12/15/2020 03:52 PM 49 - I feel penalties should be imposed for those who do not remove ice & snow from sidewalks asap 50 not checked, don't know, no opinion added Screen Name Redacted 48 not checked, comment added: Some intersections have no street name 12/15/2020 03:58 PM signs at even one corner - how am I supposed to know where I am or find the address I'm looking for? Also, please prune branches obstructing street signs. 53 - Curb drops are not a good design currently, since they have a "lip", or straight edge (sometimes 2 layers) between the sidewalk and street. The drop should be smooth, seamless, slope down to the street. A solution to improve old curb drops would be to use cement filler as is done in Oak Bay Village shopping area. Repaint white lilnes at pedestrian crosswalks that have been obliterated due to construction (or traffic use), eg, Cranmore Rd & Hampshire. 54 - Install a calming circle / roundabout at Cranmore Rd, Page 120 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire between St. Ann & Beach Dr. to slow down speeding cars & drag racers; a wise choice would be at Cranmore & Monteith, since this is an access point for children going to the Firehall playground. Screen Name Redacted Cycling lanes are great - but please remember all taxpayers are not able to 12/15/2020 04:03 PM cycle. Please, please make a standard for lights and reflective clothing and license all cyclists with a fee. Don't put 2-way cycling lanes on one way streets like Victoria has. Absolutely insane for drivers. Screen Name Redacted The Municipality needs to take into consideration that there are residents, 12/15/2020 04:07 PM both old & young, with mobility issues who are unable to negotiate sidewalks that have no curb drops. Optional question (132 response(s), 178 skipped) Question type: Essay Question Filtering by: <p>Location of residence</p> North-of-Oak-Bay-Avenue , South-of-Oak-Bay-Avenue Q53 Are there any other services that the District provides that you would like to see adjusted? Screen Name Redacted Improvement in bike lanes and a real committment to supporting other 11/02/2020 10:02 PM modes of transportation. Just look at the good work that Victoria and Saanich are doing. Screen Name Redacted Financial statements should break out parks from recreation and culture. 11/03/2020 02:05 AM (revenues and expenditures) Screen Name Redacted We should be able to have old empty self-remediated in-ground oil tanks 11/03/2020 11:12 AM inspected and signed off as non-hazards. Screen Name Redacted It's disappointing that many houses are demolished and replaced by 11/03/2020 10:15 PM esthetically and architecturally uninspired houses that are utterly unaffordable. Local residents and young families are now priced out of Oak Bay. These developments need to be stopped. Screen Name Redacted protected bike lane on OB Avne from Foul Bay Road to Newport. build it and 11/04/2020 12:00 PM City of Victoria will connect it to Pandora/Fort Screen Name Redacted Would like greater amalgamation with city of victoria and saanich 11/05/2020 04:24 PM Screen Name Redacted Ensure access to Drop Off Depot is available to all residents - both vehicle 11/05/2020 08:11 PM and non-vehicle owners. Screen Name Redacted City watering on certain streets in front of homes needs to stop. This is very 11/05/2020 10:11 PM wasteful, unnecessary and costly to maintain.

Young people are constantly harassed 11/06/2020 10:42 AM by officers. Screen Name Redacted more deer control!! 11/06/2020 12:56 PM Screen Name Redacted All grants should be voted on using a participatory model. That is , cap 11/06/2020 07:16 PM amounts would be voted on for cultural grants, emergency services, and other categories allowing citizens to decide where most of the grant money should go. Screen Name Redacted Willows Beach is the most beautiful beach in the city but little to no money 11/06/2020 08:23 PM has been spent to enhance or beautify the area in 30 years. Simply maintaining and not improving seems short sighted. Screen Name Redacted Facilitating and supporting small businesses in OB, especially cafes and 11/06/2020 08:38 PM restaurants to make OB more attractive for local residents (so we don't have to leave Ob for entertainment) Screen Name Redacted Get rid of the “ 11/06/2020 09:21 PM Screen Name Redacted Building and planning should be warm and welcoming.

Screen Name Redacted less public art 11/12/2020 06:06 AM Screen Name Redacted Increase bylaw enforcement for Covid infraction. 11/12/2020 09:09 AM Screen Name Redacted The very dangerous intersection of where Beach Drive meets Cadboro Bay 11/12/2020 09:46 AM Road needs to be made a 90 degree T intersection rather than the current very dangerous 5 degree intersection. Drivers & cyclists treat the current intersection like a freeway on ramp. Page 123 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire Screen Name Redacted Increase number of indoor and outdoor courts for pickleball; increase the 11/12/2020 04:47 PM number of hours that existing and new pickleball courts can be accessed Screen Name Redacted Increased pedestrian safety on the Avenue. The current additions are very 11/14/2020 08:56 AM much appreciated. Screen Name Redacted No 11/14/2020 09:00 AM Screen Name Redacted Permanent speed meters should be installed on problem speed areas such 11/14/2020 04:09 PM as McNeill Avenue and Foul Bay Road between McNeill and Oak Bay Ave. Screen Name Redacted Allow children to use the pool during covid in a more inclusive way. consider 11/14/2020 09:40 PM changing the divide between old and young to be more inclusive both ways. Screen Name Redacted Focus on core services such as sewer, water, sanitation. Plan to limit tax 11/15/2020 02:55 PM increase next year - this year’s increase was too high given the economy. Screen Name Redacted Once again difficult to comment as I am new here, for sure I would like more 11/15/2020 10:23 PM bike lanes, more pickle ball courts and more off leash dog parks. I really love being able to sit at outdoor patios, would love more of this. Love the outdoor concerts too! Screen Name Redacted Dump on Elgin rd needs to be monitored 11/16/2020 12:53 PM Screen Name Redacted Expand the collection of certain waste products at the municipal yard such as 11/16/2020 02:17 PM wood products. Don't make citizens go elsewhere and have to pay for dumping. pY Screen Name Redacted I would like to see a stronger role for the Heritage Commission to ensure it 11/16/2020 06:31 PM plays a significant role in the rapid redevelopment of Oak Bay, setting design standards and being a key participant in Design Panel decisions. Screen Name Redacted Less parking and better use of Turkey Head 11/16/2020 07:27 PM Screen Name Redacted I’d like to see Animal Control decrease their patrols. Most dog owners are 11/17/2020 09:07 PM responsible and we don’t need to police dog walkers. Screen Name Redacted Animal Control should not be so strict 11/18/2020 09:08 PM Screen Name Redacted Animal control needs to be decreased. It is getting out of hand. 11/19/2020 11:09 AM Screen Name Redacted The city dump off Elgin is a god send.

That's a global issue/international issue. Screen Name Redacted Geographical police patrols - patrol areas when the problems are. 11/20/2020 07:21 PM Screen Name Redacted Get rid of all the gas powered leaf blowers. They blow exhaust and leaf mold 11/20/2020 09:02 PM all over the neighbours yards. They are so noisy cannot be out in your own yard. Some neighbours use these leaf blowers all summer. They destroy relations with neighbours. Screen Name Redacted I would like yard clippings etc collected with compost in existing green bins, 11/21/2020 11:13 PM as in Saanich, perhaps with less frequent pick-up... say every three weeks instead of two. Screen Name Redacted Benches, sidewalks, roadways. 11/22/2020 12:06 PM Screen Name Redacted Proper dog park 11/22/2020 12:08 PM Screen Name Redacted Priority is ensuring the basic infrastructure is adequately maintained. 11/22/2020 06:21 PM Screen Name Redacted Bylaw enforcement on parking and suites 11/22/2020 08:12 PM Screen Name Redacted We need to 11/22/2020 10:50 PM Screen Name Redacted I liked the programme where once a year we could put items for pick up on 11/23/2020 10:01 AM the curb. Screen Name Redacted Charge for parking at Willows Beach during summer months so that beach 11/23/2020 10:56 AM users help pay for some of the upkeep. Screen Name Redacted Increase public garbage can collection during nicer weather so garbage cans 11/23/2020 07:16 PM are not over flowing Page 125 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire Screen Name Redacted I would like to see an increase in community garden spaces available, with 11/23/2020 08:25 PM priority given to renters, youth, and people facing food insecurity. Screen Name Redacted Consider prorating dog license fees. 11/23/2020 09:39 PM Screen Name Redacted We would love to see better usage of the the Kiwanis Tea Room. With a five 11/25/2020 10:10 AM star location, we should have more to offer there than one star food. This should be a year round operation for everyone to enjoy. Screen Name Redacted I do not support protected bike lanes. I do support painted bike lanes on 11/28/2020 10:56 AM roads. There are so many quiet backroads I can take as a cyclist, and protected bike lanes cause so many problems for motorists and parking spots. Screen Name Redacted To much spent on planning/OCP. 11/28/2020 02:50 PM Screen Name Redacted Less hiring of senior level staff with large salaries/benefits. 11/28/2020 05:40 PM Screen Name Redacted There needs to be a project management process in which the applicant can 11/28/2020 07:07 PM see where things are in a process along with what is required and expected timelines....basically a transparent project management system. Screen Name Redacted The IT support needs to be reviewed and upgraded. The website is not user 11/29/2020 02:41 PM friendly, the webcasts remain frustratingly limited in what can be seen and heard in terms of speakers and presentations. Screen Name Redacted Eliminate development that increases household densification by more than a 11/29/2020 03:43 PM factor or 4. Screen Name Redacted No 11/29/2020 03:55 PM Screen Name Redacted I think the District should reevaluate decorating so heavily for the "Christmas 11/29/2020 04:49 PM season". Although this community is painfully white and not diversified at all, it would be appropriate to acknowledge that Christmas decorations can be alientaing to citizen. Screen Name Redacted I think it might be time to expand the services at Elgin Riad. Those trips can 11/29/2020 06:38 PM be stressful and rushed and I think there is potential for back injury when people are rushing to unload.

Screen Name Redacted The Municipal Hall has been closed forever - we moved here in April and still 11/02/2020 03:06 PM haven't been able to get a resident's parking permit. If it's acceptable for stores, libraries, restaurants, and schools to open (with proper precautions) surely Municipal Hall can open too? Screen Name Redacted Remove more parking stalls on the Avenue and allow more cafes, Page 145 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire 11/02/2020 10:02 PM restaurants to expand their seating.

Screen Name Redacted Encouraging/enforcing masks being worn in public areas (following BC 11/03/2020 10:15 PM ministry and federal recommendations) Screen Name Redacted pretty sure ob was a leading municipality in how it handled COVID! 11/04/2020 12:00 PM Screen Name Redacted Remove wide sidewalks on OB Avenue 11/05/2020 04:10 PM Screen Name Redacted safety of busy walking areas (e.g. crescent & king george terrace) - needs a 11/05/2020 04:24 PM bump out or island.

Screen Name Redacted More public communication? 11/06/2020 12:20 AM Screen Name Redacted library services. could have provided request/pick up in Oak Bay Branch 11/06/2020 07:27 AM much earlier. UVic. Library provided this service for example. Screen Name Redacted satisfied 11/06/2020 09:43 AM Screen Name Redacted 1. Maintain walking trail networks. specifically in uplands park! 11/06/2020 10:08 AM Screen Name Redacted Communicate what you did, because I have no idea. 11/06/2020 10:25 AM Page 146 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire Screen Name Redacted REDUCING OUR TAXES not INCREASING our taxes during a pandemic. 11/06/2020 07:16 PM This increase was th- highest in all of CRD- Shameful! Enforcement of social distancing , especially in the BIA Modernizing OBEP to response to more than just fires or earthquakes. Screen Name Redacted 1) I deal with Oak Bay Recreation in relation to the arena use and the 11/06/2020 08:23 PM protocols put into place have been excessive and really challenging for volunteer run organizations Screen Name Redacted Emails to all residents about actions taken 11/06/2020 08:38 PM Screen Name Redacted Consider the hurtful impact on housing affordability caused by lack of 11/06/2020 11:19 PM densification, including garden suites in Oak Bay. Screen Name Redacted I cannot think of any. But the library (not a muni service as such, I know) has 11/07/2020 10:00 AM been very disappointing. And I am a former circulation supervisor of a major Cdn public library, so I get the challenges.... was pretty dismal. Admin, maybe. Screen Name Redacted We follow the BC Health expert on response. Mask wearing inside shops, 11/07/2020 12:02 PM hand sanitizer use, distancing. Screen Name Redacted Issue formal warnings, and if necessary fines, to people ignoring covid 11/07/2020 03:37 PM recommendations. Screen Name Redacted Keeping public restrooms open so that people have unfettered access while 11/07/2020 09:33 PM out walking in parks and beaches. Not opening Willows beach to dogs in March, April, May and June when staying close to home was recommended rather than travelling to other municipalities. Oak Bay has very few off leash parks whose use is not restricted by dates and times. We found it difficult to find places for our dog to play once UVIC closed the off-leash park there. Screen Name Redacted set up and promote the use of an Oak Bay testing site. 11/08/2020 09:09 AM Screen Name Redacted See above 11/08/2020 12:31 PM Screen Name Redacted Active support small businesses, provide real policy to help small business, 11/08/2020 01:17 PM work to reach the most isolated and vulnerable people to make sure they are weathering this storm. Screen Name Redacted Please submit articles to newspapers and put up signage, educational 11/08/2020 05:51 PM material explaining that some people are medically exempt from face mask wearing! It has become frightening to walk the streets with ignorant people abusing and harassing those of us UNABLE to wear a mask. We are physically distancing more than those wearing masks who feel themselves invincible, and getting sworn at. This is an untold story, and people need to Page 147 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire be better informed. Screen Name Redacted Messaging. Clarity on what the district can actually do above and beyond the 11/08/2020 08:42 PM Provincial Health Officer. Enforcement of rule breakers for covid-19. Screen Name Redacted Masks to be worn by all residents at the transfer station to protect the 11/08/2020 10:18 PM employees. Screen Name Redacted I hope you remember there is a silent majority out there who are pleased with 11/09/2020 01:17 PM your work. Please remember them/us when you are being pressured publicly by small interest groups with agendas. Teenagers need a place to go - in the past they could go swimming in the evening at Oak Bay Rec etc. Is there a way we can expand programming for young people? By the looks of it (I'm guessing) likely the Municipal Hall will need upgrades. It will never be popular with the tax payer but these are necessary costs - Better sooner than later. Screen Name Redacted Open the public works office again and make sales of dirt a possibility again. 11/09/2020 01:46 PM I'm sure this can be done safely. Screen Name Redacted coordinate improved regional communication 11/09/2020 03:46 PM Screen Name Redacted Stayed at home, used to self isolation due to living in slum at 2314 Oak Bay 11/09/2020 08:14 PM Avenue. Screen Name Redacted 1. Can you make it mandatory --- an enforced mandatory --- for people to 11/10/2020 06:50 PM wear face masks in Oak Bay stores. 2. I am not happy with the Penny Farthing taking over the sidewalk and street in front of the building. Have often had to walk through there with people shouting, laughing and coughing and I wonder about the airborne aspect of Covid-19 . Screen Name Redacted It would be good to allow walk-in garden waste disposal again at the 11/10/2020 11:40 PM municipal yard (I live close enough to come with my garden cart). But if garden waste will be picked up curb-side in the near future, that won't be necessary. Screen Name Redacted More public information 11/11/2020 09:02 AM Screen Name Redacted I haven’t noticed anything specific the district did 11/11/2020 02:50 PM Screen Name Redacted Municipal Hall being closed to public feels like overkill - please consider how 11/11/2020 03:02 PM to handle needed spikes in service like dog licenses - not all will want to go online. The garbage cans in high-volume areas like Willows were often overflowing - could have ramped up this service better. Screen Name Redacted Making crosswalks touch free (instead of installing a foot button) challenged Page 148 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire 11/12/2020 09:09 AM traffic flow Not making/implementing mask rules for Oak Bay stores and community areas Closing the town hall, without option to get in. Screen Name Redacted Masks should be mandatory in all indoor public places. 11/12/2020 09:46 AM Screen Name Redacted Continue to support outdoor sports and social activities through COVID; 11/12/2020 04:47 PM Screen Name Redacted Introduction of face-covering for all places of business. 11/13/2020 01:41 PM Screen Name Redacted Limited outdoor seating - should be permanent in summer from Monterrey to 11/13/2020 08:10 PM Hampshire on oak bay avenue Screen Name Redacted Other than what mentioned above, I did not notice a lot of other COVID 11/13/2020 10:35 PM response. Screen Name Redacted None 11/14/2020 09:00 AM Screen Name Redacted 1. Didn’t appreciate having to walk through a pub seating area to use the 11/14/2020 11:25 AM sidewalk- was always a challenge avoiding patrons and wait staff. Would have made more sense to have pedestrians walk farther out in street around the outdoor seating although perhaps not as wheelchair accessible. Would have required ramps at either end. 2. Took forever for the narrow sidewalk in front of Four Cats to be widened. Why? 3. The Oaks corner is still too narrow Screen Name Redacted Ensuring people are wearing masks in stores, particularly Fairways Creating 11/14/2020 01:03 PM a better dump to accommodate for more waste and crazy line ups Taking too long to complete jobs like the corner of Hampshire and Cranmore(?) We have to maneuver around it and its a pretty busy pedestrian space. I do not understand why it takes so long!??? Screen Name Redacted There must be a mask mandate in city buildings. There should be a more 11/14/2020 04:09 PM concerted effort to encourage all businesses within municipal boundaries to mandate masks. Screen Name Redacted Social distancing at the municipal yard was ridiculous. People can sort that 11/14/2020 04:34 PM out themselves without having patrols monitoring them! Stop acting like police or authoritarians... you are not the law and it is offensive to be interviewed about what items I have to dispose of at the municipal yard. Why are we paying for someone to stand there???? It is insane, quite frankly. I also object to having OB Rec Centre employees on full payroll with nothing to do except walk Willows beach and talk to people when the rec centres are closed. What a shameful waste of tax payer money!!!!! Screen Name Redacted It would be nice to have a slower speed limit along Beach Drive. Pedestrians 11/14/2020 06:04 PM often need to go onto the street to maintain a 2 meter physical distance. It Page 149 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire would be safer if the speed limit was 30 km/hr. It would be great to have wider sidewalks, but that would probably be rather expensive. Screen Name Redacted Let people know how many cases are in Oak Bay, where testing sites are 11/14/2020 08:06 PM and let people know number of people hospitalized at Royal Jubilee. Screen Name Redacted Create a feeling of community Make it easier for working people and children 11/14/2020 09:40 PM to register / use the rec centers Encourage the community to support local businesses - and each other Screen Name Redacted Ensuring that digitalized services are still alternately available to 11/14/2020 11:06 PM seniors/technically challenged people Screen Name Redacted I think you all did a really good job. I hope all the changes you made stick :) 11/15/2020 01:40 PM Screen Name Redacted Find discretionary expenses (non-core services) to cut or reduce so we focus 11/15/2020 02:55 PM on essential services and keeping taxes affordable. Screen Name Redacted Easier accessibility to services needed at municipal hall 11/15/2020 07:40 PM Screen Name Redacted I must say I do feel very safe and secure in lovely Oak Bay, I know we do not 11/15/2020 10:23 PM have a homeless problem so I would like to know this will not be an occurrence here although I do wish someone could come up with a solution for these poor folk, maybe we could all improve by offering more assistance just not sure how. Screen Name Redacted I haven't used other services. Schools have done well with re-opening, but 11/16/2020 12:00 PM this is an SD61 matter. Screen Name Redacted better hours at the yard and get the province to allow some open area in the 11/16/2020 12:24 PM municipal hall others stores are open just follow the rules access by phone, email and texting doesn't honestly cut it . Screen Name Redacted See above. 11/16/2020 02:17 PM Screen Name Redacted We did not step up to help with homelessness problem. 11/16/2020 06:12 PM Screen Name Redacted I really hated that the stairs up Denison Hill were closed 11/16/2020 07:27 PM Screen Name Redacted Get volunteer committee’s up and running, continue with climate change 11/17/2020 09:51 PM action Screen Name Redacted Not consider adding more tenants to existing dwellings Page 150 of 170 January 28, 2021 District of Oak Bay 2021 Budget Questionnaire 11/18/2020 04:33 PM Screen Name Redacted It would be nice to see that outdoor restaurant space extended to other 11/18/2020 06:35 PM restaurants. It felt like only one business benefitted and that seemed unfortunate -- even unfair. The municipality could have done more to "activate" the avenue in this way. With the cancellation of the Wednesday night market, and the already acceptance of Oak Bay Avenue closed at that time, could that space/time not been used to have a physically distanced dining area? Maybe let some merchants move their wears to the street? People were looking for (appropriate distanced) connections and I think with some creativity this could have been managed. Booking time slots??? . Screen Name Redacted enforce masks in public spaces such as Oak Bay Avenue 11/18/2020 09:08 PM Screen Name Redacted I think as long as OB supports the Provincial guidelines, all is good. 11/18/2020 09:57 PM Screen Name Redacted Trash cans still have lids on them in many places 11/18/2020 10:06 PM Screen Name Redacted 1) Leadership 2) Communication - lack of clear communication to residents 11/18/2020 11:34 PM about COVID issues has been frustrating. Screen Name Redacted Set up a Zoom or similar method so that something like a normal 11/19/2020 05:56 PM Council/COW atmosphere happens. Covid19 will be around for a long time. "Phone in and if busy redial" is unacceptable. Screen Name Redacted Have not always been clear and consistent in all areas of implementation. 11/20/2020 10:32 AM Somewhat lax on proximity restrictions on outdoor restaurant space. Screen Name Redacted Keep seniors centre open as much as possible and also library. No reason 11/20/2020 01:00 PM we can shop but can't go to a library to browse books and for those without computer access provide this service. Screen Name Redacted no concerns 11/20/2020 03:50 PM Screen Name Redacted With more people trying to spend time outside, the sidewalks and roads need 11/20/2020 05:23 PM serious repairs. Screen Name Redacted Post more Oak Bay news to media like the Oak Bay news. I usually avoid the 11/20/2020 09:02 PM Oak Bay website because I am already on the computer all day with work. Maybe have an Oak Bay news update on a local news station. Anywhere else bu over the internet. Maybe newsletters in our mailboxes . Be creative and find other ways of non electronic communicating. But avoid robo phone messaging.

Screen Name Redacted I have no idea what the District did. 11/21/2020 12:15 PM Screen Name Redacted More street area set aside for walking would be helpful. Also, avoiding the 11/21/2020 11:13 PM destruction of sidewalk sections for construction during this time when at all possible especially in fall and winter when it’s dark early and the weather can be bad. Screen Name Redacted Dump wait times Pool for residents only 11/21/2020 11:57 PM Screen Name Redacted Heaters, provide masks 11/22/2020 12:08 PM Screen Name Redacted Having playgrounds updated and accessible for all so that we dont have to 11/22/2020 05:11 PM be indoors to play with our children.

Screen Name Redacted ...but what about the senior population who are not technologically and social 11/23/2020 09:39 PM media savvy? Those who rely on the Oak Bay News, for example, for information need to be included too. Screen Name Redacted 1. Add Arena more sessions and add some during the evening 2. Maximum 11/24/2020 09:11 AM capacity should be increased as it is safe to do so as people don’t always show up or often people leave early 3.

Deliver curbside pickup schedule to homes. 11/28/2020 02:00 PM Provide some Christmas music in the village, recorded not live. Screen Name Redacted I wish the Rec centre would offer more on-line classes and provide a central 11/28/2020 02:59 PM information hub for all types of recreational/social activities that are accessible on-line. For example, if you wanted to find a yoga class on-line, you could go to the hub to find out what’s available. And private instructors could post their classes on the hub/site. Screen Name Redacted No comment 11/28/2020 05:40 PM Screen Name Redacted informing public of how/who to contact when individual employees don't 11/28/2020 07:07 PM respond to emails and when processes are exceedingly slow. A tracking system for applications would be helpful for applicants to access, particularly during times when the municipal hall is closed. Screen Name Redacted Some businesses (e.g. Penny Farthing/Vis-a-Vis) received an unfair 11/29/2020 10:49 AM advantage with sidewalk tables, at the expense of other businesses that lost access to immediate parking or other restaurants that didn't receive the same advantage. Screen Name Redacted More public washroom facilities should be open and maintained. 11/29/2020 01:42 PM Screen Name Redacted Use social media more. 11/29/2020 01:56 PM Screen Name Redacted Help restaurants set up more outdoors 11/29/2020 02:39 PM Screen Name Redacted See previous comments on website, webcasts and citizen input. 11/29/2020 02:41 PM Screen Name Redacted Stop large condo developments such as Bowker Place. 11/29/2020 03:43 PM Screen Name Redacted Nothing 11/29/2020 03:55 PM Screen Name Redacted Mask wearing enforcement.

Screen Name Redacted Having the councillor liaison to the public library board ask the library 12/10/2020 02:01 PM branches allow computer access for the public who rely on GVPL computers - they have no other resource. Also ask GVPL to open whole library up - likely one of only libraries in Canada not open yet.

It is dangerous. 12/10/2020 03:10 PM When patio is full, west bound traffic does not always see pedestrian crosswalk headed south. Not enough room for pedestrians to walk socially distant when tables are full and there is a waiting line to be seated. Screen Name Redacted communications on how health orders impact residents more online services 12/10/2020 05:03 PM / ensure fast response Screen Name Redacted Not utilising Oak Bay Lodge is criminal 12/10/2020 05:23 PM Screen Name Redacted easier phone-in registration process (wait times up to 17 minutes for those 12/10/2020 05:41 PM without internet access) Screen Name Redacted I don't see the wisdom of closing down outdoor spaces, such as playgrounds. 12/15/2020 03:26 PM We want people to be outside in good ventilation.

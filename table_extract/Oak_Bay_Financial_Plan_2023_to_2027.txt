Specifically, we recognize the Lekwungen-speaking people known today as the Songhees and Esquimalt Nations and that their historic connections to these lands continue to this day. The District is located on the southern tip of Vancouver Island in British Columbia, and the City of Victoria borders. The District of Oak Bay wishes to appropriately recognize the pre-incorporation history of the lands the District now occupies and seeks to develop such context in consultation with the Songhees and Esquimalt Nations. Oak Bay’s west boundary, and the District of Saanich lie to the north. Oak Bay is one of 13 member municipalities comprising the Capital Regional District. The University of Victoria is partially located in the District, as is a small portion of Camosun College. Community landmarks include other public and independent schools, two golf courses, a marina, a yacht club, and a luxury boutique hotel. Oak Bay is a beautiful seaside community with a population of approximately 18,000, defined by residential neighbourhoods, village centres with local businesses, historic character, a canopy of mature trees, accessible shorelines, and an abundance of green space. Draft 2023-2027 Financial Plan 4 4 2023-2027 Financial Plan Financial Legislation, Policy, and Best Practices 5 2023-2027 Financial Plan Financial Planning Legislation Much of the District’s financial planning process is guided by the Community Charter S. 165. The Charter requires the District to adopt a Five-Year Financial Plan Bylaw before May 15 annually. Such a Bylaw must: 1. Set out proposed expenditures, funding sources, and transfers between funds 2. Set policy and objectives related to identified funding sources, distribution of property taxes, and the use of permissive tax exemptions 3. Disclose amounts for specific expenditures such as debt interest, debt principal, and capital expenditures 4. Disclose amounts for specific funding sources such as property taxes, parcel taxes, and fees 5. Disclose the use of, and transfer to, specific reserves 6. Council may amend the Financial Plan at any point during the year but will only do so if authorized expenditure limits are likely to be exceeded Balanced budget: Current revenues, including transfers from reserves, must be sufficient to support current expenditures, including transfers to reserves. Expenditures include those of a capital nature and debt principal. Example Balanced Budget Revenues Operating expenses Accounting surplus Add: Transfers from reserves Less: Capital expenditures Less: Debt principal payments Less: Transfers to reserves Balanced budget: | $1,000,000 ( | $900,000) | $100,000 | $50,000 ( | $60,000) ( | $10,000) ( | $80,000) | $- Notice that an accounting surplus differs significantly from a budgetary surplus. A balanced budget includes expenditures that are not considered expenses under Public Sector Accounting Standards such as capital expenditures and debt principal payments. 6 2023-2027 Financial Plan Financial Planning Policy and Best Practice The District endorses a budget approach that Staff use to carry out budget deliberations. At the November 12, 2019 Regular Meeting of Council, Council endorsed a budget approach with the following principals: 1. Service Level Approach: Staff prepare the budget to deliver community services at the standard directed by Council and legislation. Staff do not increase nor decrease service levels unless directed by Council or external regulation. Staff endeavour to describe the financial impact of service-level decisions so that Council can be empowered to make decisions with all available information. Furthermore, Staff endeavour to fund and deliver services in the most cost- effective manner. Service delivery expectations will be further considered and refined by Council in 2023. Staff prepare the budget to deliver community services at the standard directed by Council and legislation 2. Alignment of Funding Sources: Staff recommend aligning expenditure funding sources as follows: • Predictable, stable, and ongoing expenditures should be funded using predictable, stable revenues such as property taxes and user fees. • Infrequent, volatile, or less predictable expenditures should be funded using reserves or debt. This will help avoid steep tax increases for capital expenses or significant operating initiatives. Reserve balances should be maintained with annual budget transfers so funds are available for large, infrequent expenditures. Budget Core Projects Operating Capital Operating Capital Predictable/Stable Expenditures Infrequent/Volatile Expenditures Taxation, Users Fees Surplus, Reserves, Grants 3. Carryover of Project Budget: The Five-Year Financial Plan authorizes expenditures over the five years. Thus, on January 1, 2023, Staff are authorized to continue spending under the Financial Plan Bylaw 2022 - 2026, No. 4811. Projects that were underway in 2022 will continue, and projects authorized to commence in 2023 will begin. Operations are not necessarily paused while the District embarks on adopting a new Five-Year Financial Plan. 7 2023-2027 Financial Plan 4. Five-Year Expenditure Authorization: Staff endeavour to prepare a Five-Year Financial Plan that is as accurate as possible and that reflects Council direction and service-level expectations. In this way, Staff work can continue while the Financial Plan is being refined in the first quarter of the year. The 2023 Financial Plan will outline general operations as well as specific initiatives planned for the entire five-year cycle. Council approval of the Financial Plan Bylaw will be considered endorsement and direction for the listed projects, initiatives, and operating expenditures that make up the rolled-up bylaw totals. 5. Financial Plan Bylaw Transparency: The Financial Plan Bylaw is summarized on a high level to maximize operational flexibility while retaining expenditure authorization. The published Financial Plan document will not form part of the Bylaw but will expand the Bylaw detail for transparency. Financial Plan Bylaw • Legal spending authority • Summarized on a high level for operational flexibility Financial Plan Document • Minimal legal basis • Expands Bylaw in great detail for transparency and accountability 6. Life-Cycle Costing: Staff will integrate annual life-cycle costs into the Financial Plan when new capital expenditures are approved. Life-cycle costs include the additional operating costs to maintain the asset and as annualized asset replacement contributions. 7. Revenue from New Development Taxation (NDT): NDT revenue is derived from new buildings or newly subdivided lots and are considered taxation revenue from assessed values that did not exist in the previous year. As the District develops, so will the pressure on existing services and infrastructure required to serve new citizens. The District will use NDT revenue to fund the incremental costs of new development, including expanded operating expenses, as well as infrastructure maintenance and replacement. It is recommended that the District not use NDT revenue to reduce the tax burden for existing citizens, as this is unsustainable and will result in sharper future tax increases and intergenerational funding inequity. + | $+ | $+ | $Rezoning Subdivision Building Permit - | $- | $- | $- | $Light infrastructure maintenance New operating costs Heavy infrastructure maintenance Infrastructure Infrastructure replacement 8 2023-2027 Financial Plan Financial Planning and Reporting Timeline Fin.

Purchasing Bylaw/Policy The authority to make purchasing decisions, and to bind the Corporation contractually rests with Council unless delegated by bylaw. The District’s “Delegated Authority of Administrative Functions Bylaw, 2004” delegates this authority to specific staff within limits. This bylaw was amended in 2019 to grant this authority to specific Managers and Directors, as well as the Chief Administrative Officer. The District’s purchasing bylaw refers to a recently adopted (2019) Sustainable Procurement Policy, which sets purchasing limits and processes for Staff. Additionally, the policy outlines procedures for asset disposal and emergency expenditures. This policy complies with Municipal, Academic Institution, School, and Hospital (M.A.S.H) sector trade requirements and purchasing case law. References: Bylaw No. 4239, Delegated Authority of Administrative Functions Bylaw; Special Meeting of Council December 12, 2019 9 2023-2027 Financial Plan Reserve Fund Bylaw and Reserves and Surplus Policy The Community Charter empowers Council to establish, by Bylaw, reserve funds. These reserve funds may not be spent except for the specified reserve fund purposes, as outlined by the Bylaw. Use of funds is authorized via the annual Financial Plan Bylaw. In early 2020, Council adopted the “Reserve Funds Bylaw, 2020” which consolidated the already established reserve funds, and repealed 10 historical reserve fund Bylaws in the process. The eight reserve funds specified in this Bylaw include: 1. Machinery and Equipment 2. Fire Machinery and Equipment 3. Heritage 4. Land Sale 5. Park Acquisition 6. Capital Works 7. Alternative Transportation 8. Village Parking Reserve funds may not be spent except for the specified reserve fund purposes *For more information on fund balances and purposes, please see the Capital Plan section of this Financial Plan. The District adopted the Reserves and Surplus Policy in 2018. This Policy outlines general objectives of reserves and good reserve background information. References: Bylaw No. 4747, Reserve Funds Bylaw, 2020; Regular meeting of Council January 27, 2020 10 2023-2027 Financial Plan Investment Policy In early 2020, the Council adopted the District’s Investment Policy, 2020, wherein section 183 of the Community Charter lists the security types that the District may invest in. These securities include: 1. Securities of the Municipal Finance Authority (MFA) 2. Pooled investment funds under Section 16 of the Municipal Finance Authority Act 3. Securities of Canada or of a province 4. Securities guaranteed for principal and interest by Canada or by a province 5. Securities of a municipality, regional district, or greater board 6. Investments guaranteed by a Chartered bank 7. Deposits in a savings institution or non-equity membership shares of a credit union Prior to 2020, the District’s Investment Policy had not been updated since 2004. The 2004 Policy restricted the District’s investments to MFA pooled funds, chartered banks, or Canadian treasury bills. The new Policy sets diversification limits and articulates investment objectives in the following order: 1. Preservation of capital 2. Liquidity 3. Return on investment References: Investment Policy, 2020; Regular meeting of Council January 13, 2020 Asset Management Policy In 2018, Council adopted the District’s Asset Management Policy. The Policy captures Council’s direction regarding asset management practices and infrastructure renewal in the District, with the fundamental aim of an asset management approach focused on the development of a plan and execution of a framework that ensures sustainable service delivery. Some of the guiding principles found in the Policy include: • • Sustainable service delivery Sustainable service delivery may require innovative solutions but will leverage lessons learned in other communities. An additional key deliverable of the Asset Management Policy will be the creation and implementation of decision-making tools enabling Council to manage infrastructure risk as a core part of capital planning. Expense Reimbursement Policy At the Regular Council Meeting on October 26, 2020, the District adopted its new Travel and Expense Reimbursement Policy. This Policy governs reimbursement for staff travel and accommodation for work-related purposes. The Policy objective is to ensure travel is appropriately authorized, care has been exercised to minimize costs, and employees are fairly reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses. 11 2023-2027 Financial Plan Department Budget Transfer Policy At the Regular Council Meeting on October 26, 2020, the District adopted its new Department Budget Transfer Policy. This Policy governs the use of authorized expenditures within department operating and capital budgets. Property Tax Exemption Policy Section 165 of the Community Charter requires the District to set out the objectives and policies related to the use of permissive tax exemptions in its annual Financial Plan Bylaw. The following is an excerpt from the Financial Plan Bylaw 2019, No. 4727: “The objective being to distribute tax burden fairly among properties receiving municipal services, Council makes very little use of its authority to grant permissive tax exemptions. The Policy to date has been to grant permissive exemptions only for land and improvements appurtenant to property already exempted by statute (e.g., churches), portions of municipal land leased or licensed to non-profit organizations providing a service complementary to municipal services, and, in one case, an institution of childhood learning not statutorily exempt.” Grant in Aid Policy In 2015, a Grant Policy working group was brought together to work on a policy to provide Council with guidance on the evaluation of grant in-aid applications. Council adopted the Policy in 2015. Some of the Policy’s features can be summarized as follows: • • • Grants should align with the OCP and strategic priorities Grants should primarily benefit Oak Bay residents Grants should not subsidize services normally funded by other levels of government • One-time grants are given preference over recurring • Grants should not be provided to an individual Whistleblower Policy – Reporting, Investigation, and Protection At the Regular Meeting of Council of February 10, 2020, Council adopted the District’s Whistleblower Policy. The purpose of the Policy is to facilitate the disclosure of wrongdoing that is contrary to the public interest. A Whistleblower Policy encourages a culture where wrongdoing can be addressed quickly and appropriately.

The remaining 0.7 FTE funding has been integrated into the 2024 financial year in the 2023-2027 Financial Plan. 5. At the March 16 Committee of the Whole Meeting, Council approved an overall funding increase. This limited available funding from the recommended 2.7 FTES to 1.7 FTEs. Part of this funding has been phased into the 2024 financial year in the 2023-2027 Financial Plan. 6. Departments may also fund staffing via cost-recovery and/or capital budgets. Such staffing is not reflected in this chart. 7. Majority of these new FTEs are funded by increased recreational programming revenue with the exception of the positions listed in the Parks, Recreation, and Culture Operating Budget Summary. 14 2023-2027 Financial Plan Council Priorities and Other Initiatives Council Priorities and other initiatives are one-time or infrequent operating projects that do not include capital projects. The initiatives below are a combination of Council- directed priority projects as well as staff recommended initiatives. Council Priority Project progress is recorded and tracked in the Council Priorities Plan. Initiatives Funding These projects are not integrated into the ongoing operating budget since taxes and user fees fund the operating budget. Integrating these projects into the operating budget would result in significant tax and user fee volatility. Instead, these projects receive funding through grants and any accumulated surpluses, with no impact to tax rates. Using accumulated surplus to fund expenditures is not generally sustainable since the fund has a finite balance. Legislation prevents the District from budgeting transfers to the accumulated surplus fund, therefore Council exercises discretion when approving the use of accumulated surplus funds. Staff propose these projects be funded as noted in the chart on page 17. However, actual completion of these projects—and the related expenditures— will likely carry forward to future years. Council exercises discretion when approving the use of accumulated surplus funds 15 2023-2027 Financial Plan Council Priority Projects and Other Operating Projects Council priority projects are one-time or infrequent projects not funded by core operating budgets. The District’s annual budget cycle provides Council with the ability to either confirm or adjust priorities. Council’s 2022-2026 priority themes were identified in late 2022, following the municipal election. Priority themes are as follows: • • • • • • Housing: Enable creation of more diverse and affordable housing that is responsive to current and future community/regional needs and climate change imperatives Livability: Invest in infrastructure, facilities, natural assets and services to preserve or improve long term financial sustainability and community value/livability Transportation: Advance low and no carbon, accessible, and active transportation mobility infrastructure and services Climate Change and Environment: Proactively mitigate and adapt to climate change to preserve and enhance the environment Diversity and Inclusion: Cultivate diversity and inclusion and ensure a sense of community belonging and safety for people of all identities, ages, and backgrounds Truth and Reconciliation: Advance Truth and Reconciliation with Indigenous peoples based on respect and desire for shared prosperity Each year, Council decides which projects to fund to advance priority themes. Council’s decisions are then reflected in the Five-Year Financial Plan. Funded projects are listed in the Council Priorities Plan and progress is reported bi-annually. Both the Council Priorities Plan and bi-annual progress reports are provided on the District’s website. 16 2023-2027 Financial Plan Please see Appendix A for Operating Project descriptions. 17 2023-2027 Financial Plan Consolidated Financial Plan – 2023 Executive Summary The proposed 2023-2027 Financial Plan is summarized as follows: 2022 Budget ( | $Millions) 2023 Budget ( | $Millions) | $Increase ( | $Millions) % Increase Operating Revenues Operating Expenses Transfers from Reserves Capital Expenditures Debt Principal Transfers to Reserves Total | $52.1 (44.8) 20.5 (18.9) (0.1) (8.8) | $- | $63.4 (49.0) 30.4 (34.1) (0.1) (10.6) | $- | $11.3 (4.2) 9.9 (15.2) - (1.8) | $- 21.7% 9.4% 48.3% 80.4% - 20.5% Discussion of budgetary trends: Revenues: Revenues are budgeted to increase by | $11.3M or 21.7%. This is largely due to a combination of factors: • • • • Grants (Capital) are planned to increase by | $5.7M. Last year the District had applied to the Investing in Canada Infrastructure grant Program in support of the Uplands Sewer Separation project. This application is under consideration. This project and others are grant contingent. Property taxes are budgeted to increase by | $3.5M or 11.6%. Please see a breakdown of this increase below. Parks, Recreation, and Culture (PRC) revenues are forecasted to rise by | $1.0M. The PRC financial performance is discussed on page 67 of this Plan. Investment Income is budgeted to increase by | $639,000 (or 96.55%). The primary driver of this increase is a significant increase in market yields since early 2022. The District expects to utilize a significant portion of its reserves over the life of this Financial Plan, thereby reducing investment returns. Property taxes are budgeted to increase by | $2.8M or 9.2% Expenses: Expenses are budgeted to increase by | $4.2M (9.4%). Much of this increase ( | $1.2M) is the result of a rise in PRC’s operating department expenditures which are offset by more than a | $1.0M increase in PRC revenues. Forced growth has been estimated to be approximately 6.8%. Capital Expenditures: Budgeted capital expenditures have increased by approximately | $15.2M (80.4%). Inclusion of the Uplands Sewer Separation project accounts for | $8.8M. Furthermore, on June 27, 2022, Council authorized a significant expansion to the District’s core infrastructure renewal programs: Pavement, Sanitary Sewer, Drainage, and Water. Lastly, the District’s Facility Capital Budget has been created and funded to carry out projects found in the Facilities Master Plan and other general capital renewal projects. 18 2023-2027 Financial Plan Reserve transfers: The District is rapidly increasing its utility and tax funded transfers reserve to support forthcoming capital expenditures. The District’s recently published draft Sustainable Infrastructure Replacement Plan (SIR Plan) estimates that | $12.8M is the annual sustainable transfer. The 2023 Financial Plan increases the annual transfer to | $10.8M which is 70% of the recommended | $12.8M. Note that replacement costs are likely to have significantly increased since the preparation of the SIR Plan. Staff have estimated that the annualized cost of infrastructure replacement (sustainable transfer) may exceed | $15M by 2027. Overall, the Financial Plan results in a 9.2% tax increase, (or | $311 to the median residential property) for 2023: Reason for tax increase | $Amount Tax Increase % | $Increase to Median Residential Property Forced growth | $1,717,000 5.69% | $192 Infrastructure (transfer to reserve funding) New staffing to support sustainable service delivery 603,000 2.00% 452,400 1.50% 68 51 Total | $2,772,400 9.19% | $311 Forced growth is discussed in the subsequent section below: New staff funding approved by Council at the March 16, 2023 Committee of the whole meeting has been distributed as follows. Note that some of the positions received phased funding for 2023 and the remainder in 2024.

Note that the Financial Plan authorized overall organizational spending authority for Council envisioned service levels. The Financial Plan is not a spending forecast as authorized spending often exceeds actual spending. The leadership team have identified several risks that may impact future financial results: 1. Infrastructure replacement The District’s recently published draft SIR Plan estimates that approximately | $297M (2021 dollars) worth of the District’s assets are past their recommended useful life. The Plan recommends accelerated capital replacement output by three-five times per year, estimated to be an additional | $30-60M over the life of this Financial Plan. Council approved accelerated capital output on June 27, 2022 to help address the backlog of infrastructure replacement. A significant increase in capital output is authorized in the draft 2023-2027 Financial Plan. Although reserve contributions continue to escalate at a fast pace, overall reserve balances are forecasted to drop significantly due to increased capital output. See page 81 for the reserve forecast section. Council approved accelerated capital output on June 27, 2022 to help address the backlog of infrastructure replacement 2. COVID-19 The pandemic had a significant impact on the District’s PRC revenue due to ongoing Government regulations that restricted capacity and reduced overall demand. PRC revenues are rebounding but still fall short of pre-pandemic levels. The 2023 Financial Plan’s net PRC budget (revenues less expenditures) falls short of the pre-pandemic budget by approximately | $1.4M (adjusted for inflation). This shortfall is currently being offset by use of the COVID-19 restart grant. As the pandemic is still ongoing, PRC revenue and expense forecasts may materially change the forecasts prepared to inform this Financial Plan. 3. Oak Bay Marina Lease Negotiation In October of 2022, the District signed a five-year lease with a Lessee for the Oak Bay Marina. Lease terms provide the District and the Lessee with the ability to terminate the lease of the Restaurant and Coffee Shop with 30 days’ notice. This presents the District with cash flow risk. The 2023-2027 has integrated reduced forecasted lease cash flows as result. 4. Workforce Labour Shortages The District is currently experiencing the impacts of workforce labour shortages. It is estimated that District job posting volume increased by over 44% from 2021 to 2022 and by over 175% since 2020. Labour shortages have a negative impact on a Department’s ability to deliver community services. These workforce challenges currently reduce the District’s ability to offer a greater volume of recreational programming. This has had a negative impact on the District’s ability to recover to pre-pandemic recreational financial performance. 20 2023-2027 Financial Plan 5. Fire Master Plan The 2023-2027 Financial Plan does not include additional expenditures contemplated in the Fire Master Plan presented to the Committee of the Whole on January 16, 2023. A funding request for two Full Time Equivalent (FTE) firefighters has been integrated into the 2023-2027 Financial Plan, subject to Council approval. 6. Parks, Recreation, and Culture Financial Performance: The pandemic had a significant impact on the District’s Parks, Recreation, and Culture (PRC) revenue due to ongoing Government regulations that restricted capacity and reduced overall demand. PRC revenues are rebounding but still fall short of pre- pandemic levels user fee recovery rates. The District has been utilizing COVID-19 Restart grant proceeds to offset the impact of revenue losses. This practice has reduced the need to increase taxes to maintain PRC service levels. This reserve is forecasted to be almost completely utilized by the end of 2023, unless PRC net expenses are less than budgeted. Should the PRC net financial performance not improve beyond 2023 budgeted levels, increased taxation will be required to maintain existing service levels. It is estimated that the current funding gap (when compared to 2020 budgeted net financial performance) is | $1.2m (or 4% property tax increase), after net financial performance has been adjusted for inflation. Parks, Recreation, & Culture Recovery Rates 80% 70% 60% 50% 40% 30% 20% 10% 0% 69.70% 63.50% 65.60% 46.90% 59.20% 53.30% 56.10% 51.90% 39.20% 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Actual Budget 21 2023-2027 Financial Plan 7. Inflation and Forced Growth Inflation has significantly impacted the local government sector in BC through 2022 and into 2023. The Victoria Consumer Price Index (CPI) from December 2021 to December 2022 was approximately 6.4%. CPI is not often a great indicator of municipal costs as municipalities face a variety of different cost pressures, and in different weightings than that of the conventional CPI measure. Consequently, local governments thoroughly review their individual cost drivers and determine overall funding increases to maintain existing service levels. Some of the noteworthy cost drivers for the 2023 Financial Plan are noted below: • Municipal Wages: Collective bargaining for the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) Local 374 and the Oak Bay Police Association recently concluded. Wage settlements were substantially higher than what was predicted in the 2022 Financial Plan. This creates a compounding impact in the 2023 Financial Plan. For instance, CUPE wages were forecasted to increase by 2% for 2022 and 2023 in the 2022 – 2026 Financial Plan. Actual wage increases were 3.25% and 4% respectively. Accordingly, the 2023 increase was 4% plus the underestimate from 2022 resulting in an overage wage increase of above 5%. • Natural Gas: Natural gas unit rates rose over 20% in 2022. • Equipment Costs: Equipment costs are pooled and include insurance, gasoline, repairs and parts, and forecasted replacement costs. While a comprehensive review of equipment costs was not conducted, significant cost pressures are clearly evident, including gasoline and replacement costs. Consequently, equipment costs were increased by 10% in the 2023 Financial Plan. • Oak Bay Marina Lease: expected cash flows from the restaurant and café lease were discounted due to uncertainty imposed by new month to month lease terms. • Insurance Costs: property and general liability insurance premiums have been increased by 15%. This premium includes a 4% rate stability discount through MIABC which will be removed in time. The District is currently paying an additional 15% ‘experience adjustment’ factor in general liability premiums due to claims history. • Legal Costs: Staff have been escalating the legal budget incrementally by 13-15% per year since 2021 in order to establish a budget that resembles historical actuals. 22 2023-2027 Financial Plan Consolidated Financial Plan – Year Over Year Change 23 2023-2027 Financial Plan 24 2023-2027 Financial Plan Consolidated Financial Plan – 2023 to 2027 25 2023-2027 Financial Plan 26 2023-2027 Financial Plan Revenue Discussion Taxation Discussion Property value tax is the principal source of revenue for most local governments. It is a tax levied on the value of land and improvements (i.e., building and fixtures). Municipalities levy property value taxes based on tax revenue needs set out in their annual budget (financial plan). Property value taxes are calculated by applying a set tax rate against the assessed value of a property. Municipal tax rates are annually set by Council, and the assessed values are set independently by BC Assessment. Tax Stability, Predictability, Collectability In most years, taxation revenue is predictable and stable with the District’s tax base being 96% residential. Therefore, disruptions in non-residential assessments would not interfere with tax revenues enough to significantly impact the predictability of tax revenues overall. In fact, a uniform and significant reduction in assessed values would be unlikely to disrupt such revenues. The British Columbia legislated model of property taxation administration is one of the most efficient in the world. Tax revenue collection is highly likely in most cases. The Local Government Act requires the District to commence tax sale proceedings in cases where three years of taxes remain unpaid. Section 250 of the Community Charter writes: “Taxes accrued and to accrue on land and improvements... are a charge that; (a) is a special charge on the land and improvements, (b) has priority over any claim, lien, privilege, or encumbrance of any person except the Crown…” Therefore, taxes are discharged, at a minimum, when the property changes ownership or during tax sale proceedings. Although exceedingly rare, tax sale proceedings can result in the property being auctioned, which ensures property taxes are collectible. 27 2023-2027 Financial Plan Relationship between Assessments and Taxation Municipalities use assessed values to apportion property taxes to individual taxpayers. For instance, if a taxpayer’s assessment represents 5% of the entire taxable assessment base, that taxpayer will pay 5% of the municipal property tax budget. A common misconception is that a significant increase in assessed value will necessarily result in a significant increase in property taxes. It is more important for a taxpayer to consider the assessed value in relation to the average assessment increase. It is possible for one’s assessment to decrease while taxes increase and vice versa. Assessment Change Fin. Planning Property Tax Impact Lower than average assessment increase/decrease Individual percentage tax increase less than total district percentage tax increase Average assessment increase/decrease Individual percentage tax increase equals the total district percentage tax increase Higher than average assessment increase/decrease Individual percentage tax increase greater than total district percentage tax increase The 2023 Completed Assessment Roll indicates a 9% average increase in residential assessed properties. The preliminary property tax increase for 2023 is 9.2%. This means that properties with an assessment change above 9% will incur a tax increase greater than 9.2%. Average assessment increase: +9% +6% +7% +8% +9% +10% +11% +12% +13% +14% +15% +6% +7% +8% +9% +10% +11% +12% +13% +14% +15% +16% Average tax change: +9.2% 28 2023-2027 Financial Plan New Development Taxation (NDT) Revenue NDT revenue is derived from new buildings or newly subdivided lots. In other words, NDT is taxation revenue from assessed values that did not exist in the prior year. Staff have estimated approximately | $120,000 derived from NDT Revenue in 2023 with final NDT numbers available in March with the release of the revised assessment roll. NDT revenues were used in the 2023 year to offset the cost of increased staff funding. Five-Year Property Taxation Forecasts The draft 2023 – 2027 Financial Plan forecasts an average tax increase of 7.9% for the five years and an average increase of | $312 for 2023 through 2027.

Properties identified in this Bylaw pay a tax based on taxable frontage. The District’s Park’s crew maintain the boulevards adjacent to these properties. The District has an administrative policy of setting its boulevard tax revenue budget to recover approximately 75% of the boulevard maintenance costs. Boulevard maintenance costs have exceeded the budget every year since at least 2017. Staff have increased the boulevard maintenance budget significantly in 2023 to reflect this trend. As such, an increase to the tax will be required. Staff are recommending a 10% per year phase-in approach until the 75% ratio is achieved.

Properties identified in this Bylaw pay a tax based on taxable assessment. Taxes from this levy are remitted to the Oak Bay Business Improvement Association (BIA). The Oak Bay BIA exists to promote local member businesses and contribute to the community at large. The BIA’s term expires on December 31, 2024 if it is not renewed with another bylaw. 30 2023-2027 Financial Plan Grant in Lieu of Taxes Federal Payment in Lieu of Tax: Federally owned properties are generally exempt from taxes under Section 125 of the federal Constitution Act, 1867. Federal properties may, however, be subject to a payment in lieu of taxes according to the federal Payments in Lieu of Taxes Act. Two such federally owned, tax exempt properties in the District pay a payment in lieu of tax, and they are: (1) Turkey Head Breakwater, and (2) Trial Island Lighthouse. Federal grant in lieu payments are generally equivalent to the amount of taxation that would have been due had the properties not been exempt. Grant in Lieu of Taxes, University of Victoria: The University of Victoria (UVic) is exempt from taxes pursuant to section 54 of the University Act. The University is situated partially in the District of Oak Bay and partially in the District of Saanich. The Ministry of Post- Secondary Education and Future Skills distributes an annual grant in lieu of taxes to local governments with universities. The funds are apportioned based on the proportional assessed value of university property within the municipality. The total grant fund budget has not changed in many years, with the actual value of the UVic property within Oak Bay assessed at | $410.5M. The grant in lieu of taxes is equivalent to approximately 2.1% of the taxation revenue that would be due on | $410.5M of taxable assessment. The foregone taxes demonstrate the District’s significant investment in post-secondary education. 31 2023-2027 Financial Plan 1% Utility Revenue Pursuant to Section 644 of the Local Government Act and the Hydro and Power Authority Annual Grants Order, utility companies must pay each municipality 1% of the revenues earned within that municipality in the preceding year. Since this revenue is based on prior year financials and amounts remitted to the District, the budget is very accurate. For 2023, 1% of revenues are forecasted as follows: Utility Company 2021 Budget 2022 Budget 2023 Budget Change Shaw Communications Telus Fortis BC Hydro Total | $28,300 | $18,500 | $38,400 | $27,300 | $18,200 | $41,200 | $25,600 | $17,500 | $50,500 - | $1,700/-6.2% - | $700/-3.8% + | $9,300/+22.6% | $136,500 | $136,700 | $142,500 + | $5,800/+4.1% | $221,700 | $223,400 | $236,100 + | $12,700/+5.7% Municipal Regional District Tax (MRDT) The Municipal and Regional District Tax (MRDT) is a tax of up to 3% on the purchase of accommodation imposed in specific geographic areas of the Province (designated accommodation areas) on behalf of municipalities, regional districts, or eligible entities. The District is a designated accommodation area according to the Designated Accommodation Area Tax Regulation 93/2013. Funds raised through the MRDT must be used for a prescribed purpose, such as tourism marketing or sport hosting marketing. As such, MRDT funds raised in the municipality of Oak Bay are used to fund Oak Bay Tourism. User Fees Section 194 of the Community Charter enables Council to impose a fee for all or part of a municipal service. In general, user fees are charged when the benefit of a service accrues to identifiable individuals, and taxes are levied when the benefit of a service accrues broadly to the public. However, Council has the authority to vary the mix and imposition of taxes and user fees as appropriate. Below are some of the user fees that the District levies: Sewer User Fees: The District levies a sewer user fee to recover 70% of the costs to maintain the municipal sanitary sewer conveyance system. Property taxes recover the remaining 30% of such costs. The sewer user fee also partially funds an annual transfer to reserve for capital asset replacement and rehabilitation. Sewer user fees are calculated by multiplying the sewer rate by 60% of water consumption for residential properties. Rates are applied to 100% of the water used by properties that are not residential, have mixed-use, or have two water meters. 32 2023-2027 Financial Plan Capital Regional District Sewer User Fee: The District levies a user fee to recover 100% of the operating costs related to providing regional sewer service, including the Core Area Wastewater Treatment Plant. This levy has experienced steep increases for several years while the Capital Regional District phased in the cost of construction. When construction was completed, costs shared between participating municipalities converted mainly to operating costs. At the Regular Meeting of Council on November 9, 2020, Council elected to recover the regional sewer operating costs via a CRD sewer user fee and the regional sewer debt and capital costs via a CRD property tax levy. At the time of writing this plan, the 2023 Draft CRD budget envisioned a moderate decrease the Core Area Wastewater Operations budget. However, the CRD sewer user fee rate was increased by 1% to reflect consumption trends. The CRD sewer user fee rate was increased by 1% to reflect consumption trends Water User Fee: The District levies a water consumption charge and a fixed user fee to recover 100% of the costs related to the provision of retail water. Most of the costs relate to the purchase of bulk water from the Capital Regional District for distribution to District citizens. The fixed fee recovers 35%, while the consumption fee recovers 65%. For properties with two or fewer units, the fixed fee is | $0.72 per day or | $262.80 per year. Solid Waste User Fee: The District levies a solid waste fee under the District’s Refuse Collection and Disposal Bylaw. The solid waste fee funds various services (described below). The District’s solid waste fee revenue exceeds the solid waste division’s direct costs and funds solid waste service infrastructure replacement and general District overhead. Solid Waste Division Service 2023 Budget Proportion Service Description Solid Waste Organics | $679,200 40% Bi-weekly curbside pickup and unlimited drop off at depot | $462,200 27% Bi-weekly curbside pickup Garden Waste Program | $212,400 13% Unlimited drop off at depot, compost sales Beach Cleanup | $12,900 Garden Waste Pickup Week | $115,100 1% 7% Two to four clean up crew days per year, or one sunken sailboat removal One day per-week, per property annual curbside garden waste Recycling Depot | $206,100 12% Unlimited drop off at depot Total | $1,687,900 100.0% 33 2023-2027 Financial Plan Grants (Operating) The District’s operating grant budget is comprised of the following four main grants: 1. Small Community Grant 2. Traffic Fine Revenue Sharing Grant 3. Local Government Climate Action Program Grant 4. Project-Related Grants 5. COVID-19 Restart Grant Grant 2022 Forecast 2022 Budget 2023 Budget Change Small Community Grant | $187,000 | $145,000 | $150,000 + | $5,000 Traffic Fine Revenue Sharing | $200,817 | $220,000 | $202,000 - | $18,000 Local Government Climate Action Program Grant | $146,082 - | $146,000 + | $146,000 Project-related grants | $63,360 | $55,700 | $37,900 - | $17,800 COVID-19 Restart Grant* | $572.900 | $1,428,600 | $1,387,800 - | $40,800 Other Total | $321,791 | $3,400 | $2,700 - | $700 | $1,491,950 | $1,852,700 | $1,926,400 + | $73,700 *This grant was remitted to the District in late 2020. Accounting standards require that the grant be recorded as revenue in 2020. The District has transferred it to its reserves for use to offset anticipated 2021, 2022, and 2023 PRC revenue shortfalls. The grant is placed in this chart for transparency; however, it will appear as a “transfer from reserve” in the Financial Plan Bylaw. Small Community Grant: This grant is an unconditional grant paid by the Province to the District. The formula that determines the grant amount is complex and is phased out as a community grows. Traffic Fine Revenue Sharing Grant: This grant amount is determined by total Provincial traffic fine revenue collected in the year prior. Oak Bay’s share of the funds is determined by the District’s policing costs as a proportion of the entire Province’s policing costs. It is difficult to forecast traffic fine revenue as it varies from year to year. Local Government Climate Action Program Grant (LGCAP): This grant is the successor to the Climate Action Revenue Incentive Program (CARIP Grant). The CARIP grant was a conditional grant program that provided funding to local governments which signed the BC Climate Action Charter. The grant was equal to 100% of the carbon taxes the District paid to support local government operations. In September 2021, the Province announced that 2021 would be the final year of the program. The CARIP Grant was replaced with the LGCAP Grant. The LGCAP provides funding for local governments to develop and implement a climate action plan that will reduce emissions, create new opportunities for people in the clean economy, and prepare communities for future climate impacts. As part of the program, recipients of funding will be required to report on their actions. Proceeds from this grant are being transferred to the District’s Climate Action reserve, much like the previous CARIP Grant funds. 34 2023-2027 Financial Plan Grants (Capital) Gas tax: The Administrative Agreement on the Federal Gas Tax Fund in British Columbia took effect on April 1, 2014. The tripartite Agreement between Canada-British Columbia-UBCM replaced the 2005-2014 Agreement and provides the administrative framework for the delivery of federal Gas Tax funding to local governments and other recipients in BC over 10 years (2014-2024). The Gas Tax fund provides predictable, long-term, and stable funding to local governments in BC for investment in infrastructure and capacity building projects. The gas tax allocation table sets out funding through 2024. 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 | $851,133.48 | $816,756.82 | $816,756.82 | $853,872.73 | $853,873.73 | $890,979.58 In 2014, when the new agreement was signed, the eligible project categories expanded significantly, prompting many communities to change their gas tax revenue recognition practices. Investment Revenue Investment returns grew considerably from 2015 – 2019 due to two main factors: (1) increased investment balances, and (2) increased money market performance. Approximately 80% of the District’s portfolio had been invested in the Municipal Finance Authority’s Money Market Fund. 2015 Actual 2016 Actual 2017 Actual 2018 Actual 2019 2020 2021 2022 | $340,809 | $304,755 | $357,143 | $744,099 | $996,143 | $831,556 | $727,480 | $1,705,977 | $174,000 | $152,000 | $130,000 | $140,000 | $301,500 | $825,000 | $562,500 | $662,500 | $35.7M | $41.0M | $46.5M | $54.1M | $60.1M | $72.2M | $70.1M | $74.3M 0.85% 0.79% 0.97% 1.65% 1.88% 0.85% 0.15% 1.93% Investment revenues Investment revenue budget Cash and Investment balance MFA money market return % The investment return budget has been increased by | $639,000 from 2022 to 2023. Market yields have increased at a historical pace since the World’s Central Banks began increasing rates. For instance, the Municipal Finance Authority Money Market Fund yield has increased from an annualized rate of 0.15% in December 2021 to 1.93% in December 2022. The Bank of Canada signaled a conditional end to rate increases at the January 2023 meeting. 35 2023-2027 Financial Plan Operating Department Summaries 36 2023-2027 Financial Plan Corporate Administration Administration consists of the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO), the Director of Corporate Services (DCS), the Deputy DCS, the Director of Strategic Planning, the Deputy Director of Strategic Initiatives, the Director of Human Resources, a Communications Specialist, the Executive Assistant to the CAO, and the Mayor, (as well as an administrative support staff person). The CAO is the general manager for the Corporation, providing guidance and direction to all operating departments, and is the principal advisor to Council. The DCS works closely with Council, is the main link between Council and the public, and is the contact for information on all Council matters. The DCS is also the custodian of municipal records and is responsible for requests submitted under the BC Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act.

The budget below includes a modest transfer to reserve budgets. This funding accumulates in a capital reserve until such time that these reserves are required to fund capital maintenance. Capital expenditures are much larger, more expensive, and prolong the building or building component life. This operating budget does not include the facility operating costs of the Police, Fire, Parks, Recreation, and Culture, and Public Works facilities. 1. The 30-year Marina lease expired December 31, 2022. This lease was replaced with a five-year lease. Terms of this lease provide both parties with the option to terminate the Café and Restaurant building lease with 30 days written notice. Given the significant cash flow uncertainty this creates lease revenues from the Café and Restaurant have been wholly removed from budget forecasts. 2. As the District does not currently have a tenant occupying this property, the District becomes responsible for maintenance and utilities. 3. The District currently engages a property management group for the management of the rental suites in this property. The property management group negotiated a significant management fee increase for this service with the District in 2022.

Focused attention on the recent increase in retirements and the 65+ population are seen as opportunities for increased participation. • Opportunity to develop outdoor spaces to offer outdoor fitness classes, although capital expenditures may be required. • Proposed new program to subsidize/reimburse certification fees to attract new front line workers and thus address labour challenges. • Proposed reduction in late night hours (i.e. after 10:00 pm) is expected to produce net savings in expenses given downward trends in participation rates. Post Pandemic fears of returning to group classes appears to be waning, group fitness classes are nearing 2019 registration levels; expect continued innovations in program offerings to meet fitness trends. • Labour challenges have constrained capacity to generate greater revenue. • Significant inflation has eroded capacity for greater net revenue. • Fees increase planned to combat inflation. • Significant certification required to meet job qualifications. • Plan to subsidize/reimburse certification fees may help attract new front line workers who are often 16-20 year olds and have expressed that certification costs are a barrier to working in aquatics. • Planned improvements of physical accessibility options for older adults and individuals with health concerns/disabilities may increase participation. • Demographic shifts of the “baby boom” generation and pandemic retirements are expected to increase participation rates in daytime swimming and aquafit programs which are popular with this age demographic. • Post pandemic increase in demand for lessons, coupled with staffing shortages lead to service delivery changes to focus on group lessons over private lessons (i.e. less staff can teach more children), however, private lessons have a higher net revenue. Long term return to offering more private lessons will provide increased net revenue opportunities in aquatics. • Proposed reduction in late night hours (i.e. after 10:00 pm) is expected to produce net savings in expenses given downward trends in participation rates after 10:00 pm. Arena • Arena assets are well utilized and used in a revenue-efficient and community service maximizing way. • Significant inflation has eroded capacity for greater net revenue. • Fees increase planned to combat inflation. • Secured new insurance option for individual/private renters to obtain insurance without being part of organized group sport which could increase rentals in Spring/ Summer months. 69 2023-2027 Financial Plan Food Services Indoor Sports Field • Labour challenges have constrained capacity to generate greater revenue. • Significant inflation has eroded capacity for greater net revenue. • • Post pandemic return of regular special events to the Monterey Centre will provide Important venue to promote social connectedness, belonging and culture. small growth opportunity. • Similarly, the return of concerts and events to the OBRC Sportsview Lounge has been steady and increasing through 2022/23. • Group meeting and/or party rentals of OBRC Lounge have grown in 2022/23 post pandemic. Small growth opportunity here for future years. • Fees increase planned to combat inflation. • Secured new insurance option for individual/private renters to obtain insurance without being part of organized group sport which could increase rentals during less popular rental times. • Facility is heavily utilized by Oak Bay High School PE classes. Sailing • No opportunities here. Currently runs with contract with Sooke, volunteers coordinate the administration which poses some challenges. Expanded to full summer program. OB pays for marina lease. 2023 have budgeted to pay for 15 hr per week in summer for a OBPRC leader to help at lunches. Revenue neutral. Society takes care of boat maintenance/costs. Evan has expanded into a fall program, but revenue will be minimal. Licensed Care • Provincial grants for families are reducing childcare costs; requires increased admin time for OBPRC staff. • Demand exists for growth as there are waitlists for all childcare spaces. • Labor challenges have constrained capacity to generate greater revenue in 2022/23, reduced provision of child care spots and reduced revenues. However, expected rebounding of child care labor will result in the ability to offer more spots; currently offering approx. 75% of full, licensed capacity thus some growth potential in this area. • Licensed Care is regulated heavily, staff to child ratios must be observed. However, if labour shortage continues to be reduced (current hiring underway), overall numbers of participants can be increased. • Labour pool is restricted by Licensing requirements which require employees to be 19 years of age, as well as the specific hours of operation make it difficult for students. • Camps and childcare are bound by staff to child ratios. If labour shortages are reduced, there is capacity for growth in the delivery of camps and programs for children. • Currently, camps are in high demand, but labour challenges have constrained capacity to generate greater revenue. Medium growth is expected through contracted camps, but this may also be impacted by labour challenges. • New Supported Child Development grant may assist in expanding one on one inclusion support services but this too, may be impacted by labour challenges. Increased grant opportunities currently exist for youth and student employment positions which will help offset wage expenses. • Community Recreation Youth Centre • Space is seen as a “community asset,” for youth in terms of providing a space place for youth to gather. Fully subsidized space as no fees are charged other than birthday party rentals. • Birthday party rentals have a small growth opportunity. • Opportunity to increase use of the space with revenue neutral impact though partnerships with community groups such as the Inter-Cultural Association, Victoria Immigrant and Refugee Centre Society and Community Living Victoria. 70 2023-2027 Financial Plan Tennis • Recent structural changes have been made to lessons format to generate more efficient revenue generation. • Significant inflation has eroded capacity for greater net revenue. • Fees increase planned to combat inflation. • Staffing challenges have not been felt as acutely in Tennis. Program structure • facilitates mentorship of young coaches. Increase in hosting tennis tournaments for improved patron engagement, potential sponsorships (may need to address with Council) and growth of participation in the sport. • Note: demand for pickleball exceeds court availability. Focus is on group use rather than private rentals. Monterey Centre • Staff continue to examine ways to creatively and efficiently utilize space to provide maximum community benefit and maximize financial performance. • Significant inflation has eroded capacity for greater net revenue. • Fees increase planned to combat inflation. • Pandemic retirements and the continued movement of the “baby boom,” demographic through retirement ages 60-70+ is expected to contribute to increased growth of participation in programs, events, trips etc. at the Monterey Centre for the next 5-10 years. • Growth in demand for older adult fitness programs expected to continue. • Post pandemic fears of registering in traditional, art and general interest programs continue as people in this age category are hesitant to sit in smaller spaces with others, however, that fear is slowly waning as we are seeing growth in program registration and expect continued growth in this area. This is a potential area for growth in return to pre-pandemic operations. • Special event and out trips cancelled due to the pandemic have only returned to approximately 25% of pre-Pandemic levels. As fears from the Pandemic continue to be reduced in the general population, more events and trips will be offered. This is a potential area for growth in return to pre-pandemic operations. • Providing increased administrative support for MMRA club, rebuilding membership after COVID, and better use of space. Par 3 Golf • Service is very weather dependent, however recent trends have seen more favorable Spring and Fall operations. • Demographic shift of “baby boom,” generation through retirement ages is expected to • contribute to the participation in golf in general. Increased demand for inter-generational activities could see greater usage in future as course is very child friendly. Neighbourhood Learning Centre • Recent regulatory requirements have constrained revenues. • Failure of room dividers has diminished the capacity for childcare spaces and fitness programs. These room dividers are slated to be replaced within the next year. • Maintenance staffing challenges have hindered rentals and usage of this space for evenings and weekends. Addressing this staff challenge should support increased rental and programming of this space. 71 2023-2027 Financial Plan Division Fitness Aquatics Arena Food Services Indoor Sports Field Sailing Licensed Care Youth Centre Tennis Monterey Centre Par 3 Golf Neighbourhood Learning Centre Staffing History and Forecast Position Auxiliary Staff Regular Total 2022 Accomplishments Capacity for Greater Revenue?

Over the coming years the District’s objective is, with respect to asset management progress, to answer three questions: One: How Well Are We Planning? • Should have Master Plans complete for all major asset classes by 2023 • Water Master Plan complete • Sanitary Sewer Master Plan complete • Facilities Master Plan underway • Stormwater Master Plan 2022-2023 Two: How Well Are We Funding? Three: How Well Are We Replacing? • District has made significant progress increasing annual funding • District’s draft Sustainable Infrastructure (SIR) Plan estimates sustainable annual funding to be | $12.8M (current funding: | $8.2M) • SIR Plan estimates a cumulative infrastructure funding deficit of | $463.5M as of 2021 • District has increased capital replacement output alongside funding increase • SIR Plan recommends increasing capital output by 300-500% for road, storm, sewer, and water over the next 15 years • Council approved five new positions for capital programming beginning in 2023 78 2023-2027 Financial Plan How well are we planning? The District provides numerous capital services for the enjoyment of its residents and visitors, as detailed below. Many of these services required significant initial investment and residents expect these services to continue uninterrupted well into the future. The District has developed Master Plans and guiding documents to support the long-term provision of these high-quality services.

The District increased annual funding by | $1.3M in 2019, | $1.3M in 2020, and | $500,000 in 2021, and | $1.0M in 2022. The draft 2023 Financial Plan increases annual asset replacement funding by an additional | $1.8M (approx. 600k due to investment returns improving). Overall, this will result in | $16.8M in cumulative funding being set aside in reserves over the course of 2018 - 2023.

On average, these assets were estimated to be 77% through their useful lives (“depreciation”). The value of this depreciation is therefore | $502.0M (653.0M X 77%). In other words, sustainable funding would have resulted in the District either replacing or saving for approximately | $502.0M. The District’s reserves available for capital replacement were estimated to be approximately | $38.5M, resulting in a | $463.5M cumulative infrastructure funding gap. These figures were prepared for the 2021 Sustainable Infrastructure Replacement (SIR) Plan. Replacement costs have escalated since the SIR Plan was prepared.

Sustainable infrastructure replacement funding is estimated to be | $12.8M in 2021 dollars. The District has made significant progress in closing the infrastructure funding gap since 2017. In 2017, funding levels were estimated to be at approximately 37% of sustainable levels. The draft Financial Plan closes this estimated funding gap to 96% by 2027.

These funding levels were based on 2021 replacement values. Replacement costs have increased significantly since and these funding targets will be revised with future revisions of the District’s Sustainable Infrastructure Replacement Plan. 83 2023-2027 Financial Plan How Well Are We Replacing? The District has increased capital replacement output significantly over the past five years. Capital progress output may be measured in the context of the total size and age of the District’s existing asset inventory. The District will be providing asset replacement output information in its asset management strategy. This information will be integrated into future financial plans. Some capital replacement output measures may include: • • Physical measurement of assets replaced, such as linear or square meters; number of units replaced Proportion of system replaced • Weighted average age of asset class • • Proportion of asset class beyond recommended useful life Condition assessment information by asset class This information, combined with the District’s forthcoming Infrastructure Replacement Plan, will be used to provide options for Council to consider the pace that assets can be replaced. The District has increased capital replacement output significantly over the past five years Asset Class Inventory Asset Type Information and Assumptions Roads Buildings Drainage Vehicles and Equip. (Fire) Staff use pavement unit rates to multiply pavement quantities to estimate replacement costs. This estimate should be revised once a pavement condition assessment is complete. Staff used recent insurance appraisals to value the replacement cost of our current inventory stock. Staff also considered the Building Asset Management report prepared by Moore Wilson Architects Inc. Staff use annual replacement cost information from the Opus International Consultants 2016 Asset Management report. Costs have been adjusted for inflation, but it is possible that rising costs have outpaced inflation. Staff use a detailed apparatus replacement plan to forecast asset replacement costs. Vehicles and Equip. (Police) Staff use a succinct Police vehicle and equipment replacement plan to forecast replacement costs. A more detailed plan is underway. Vehicles and Equip.

Furthermore, the Plan authorizes the maximum use of | $93.5M (forecasted to be | $88.5M per below). 86 2023-2027 Financial Plan 87 2023-2027 Financial Plan Five Year Reserve Projections Reserve balances for 2023 are expected to be reduced from | $56M to | $33M in 2027, should the District proceed with full authorized capital expenditures. In this timeframe, significant capital expenditures and reserve contributions are forecasted. Over the five-year period the total reserve contributions are forecasted to be approximately | $63M. Total capital expenditures over the five-year period are forecasted to be approximately | $144M ( | $50M of which is debt funded). 88 2023-2027 Financial Plan 1. Reserve projections do not include use of Major Crimes Reserve despite the draft budget authorizing expenditures from this reserve. Individual reserve fund projections are outlined below. Climate Action Reserve The District was a signatory of the BC Climate Action Charter. Under the Charter, the District commits to becoming carbon neutral in corporate operations by measuring and reporting progress and creating a more energy-efficient community. As a signatory, the District is eligible to receive 100% of the carbon taxes paid during the year as a rebate (CARIP Grant). Proceeds from this rebate have been transferred to the District’s Climate Action Reserve since 2012. In May of 2021, the Provincial Government announced this program would be wrapping up in 2021, with 2020 as the last reporting period. The CARIP Grant was replaced with the LGCAP Grant. The LGCAP provides funding for local governments to plan and implement climate action that will reduce emissions, create new opportunities for people in the clean economy, and prepare communities for future climate impacts. As part of the program, recipients of funding will be required to report on their actions. Proceeds from this grant are being transferred to the District’s Climate Action reserve, much like the previous CARIP Grant funds. Major Crimes Reserve Annually, the Police Board budgets for a transfer to the major crime reserve. These funds are set aside pursuant to the annual budget request from the Police Board. Specific provision in the District’s Reserve and Surplus Policy relate to the use of these funds. 89 2023-2027 Financial Plan Fire Machinery and Equipment Reserve Fund The Fire Machinery and Equipment reserve fund was originally established pursuant to Bylaw No. 3773, “Fire Machinery and Equipment Depreciation Reserve Fund Bylaw, 1993”. This bylaw was repealed and replaced by Bylaw No. 4747, the “Reserve Funds Bylaw, 2020”. Money in this fund, and interest earned on it, shall only be used for extending the useful life, upgrading, or replacing fire machinery and equipment. Two of the Fire Department’s major pieces of apparatus are due for replacement between 2022-2023: (1) Engine with light rescue, and (2) 75-ft Ladder Truck. These vehicles are expected to cost over | $3.2M. The Fire Machinery and Equipment reserve balance was approximately | $1.5M at the beginning of 2023. As a result of these purchases, the reserve is expected to be negative. Staff intend to temporarily borrow from other reserves to fund the purchases. Two of the Fire Department’s major pieces of apparatus are due for replacement Heritage Reserve Fund Money in this fund and interest earned on it shall only be used for land development projects and other capital projects designed to augment land development projects. The principal proceeds in this reserve were generated from the net profit from the Municipality’s development of the Wessex Close subdivision in 1980-81. Machinery and Equipment The Machinery and Equipment reserve fund was originally established pursuant to Bylaw No. 2074, “Reserve for Machinery and equipment By-law” and Bylaw No. 3773, the “Machinery and equipment Depreciation Reserve”. These bylaws were repealed and replaced by Bylaw No. 4747, the “Reserve Funds Bylaw, 2020”. Money in this fund, and interest earned on it, shall only be used for extending the useful life, upgrading, or replacing machinery and equipment. Much of the District’s fleet is due for replacement—and will be replaced in the next five years, however, reserve funding levels are believed to be sustainable for the long term. For further information on the asset replacement funding, please see the State of Asset Replacement Funding section of this Financial Plan. Parks Acquisition Reserve Fund Under Section 510 of the Local Government Act, an owner of land being subdivided into three or more lots must either provide park land or pay cash in lieu. Section 188 of the Community Charter requires that such payments be credited to a statutory reserve fund. This reserve fund may only be used for the purpose of acquiring new park lands. Capital Works Reserve Fund This reserve fund was originally established through Bylaw no. 3775, the “Capital Works and Equipment Reserve Fund Bylaw”. This bylaw has since been repealed, and replaced with Bylaw No. 4747, the “Reserve Fund Bylaw, 2020.” The primary purpose of the Capital Works Reserve Fund is to provide a means of financing major repairs or replacement of physical assets while moderating tax increases. Annual contributions for water main replacement and sewer rehabilitation are directed to this reserve, among other transfers. 90 2023-2027 Financial Plan *Note that this fund is consolidated into one balance in the District’s annual public sector accounting standard financial statements. For budgeting purposes, the District has separated the capital works reserve into three funds: general, sewer, and water. The District is entering an era of significant infrastructure replacement. As a result, the District’s Capital Works reserve is budgeted to decrease significantly over the next five years, despite increasing investment annual transfers. Capital Works Reserve funded projects include: Projects Sanitary Sewer Rehabilitation Watermain Replacement Foreshore Administration and Finance Marina Fire Department Projects Facilities Department Projects Parks and Recreation Other 2023 | $2.8M | $2.6M | $1.3M | $0.7M | $0.6M | $0.4M | $0.4M | $0.7M | $0.5M 2024 | $2.0M | $2.6M - 2025 | $2.0M 2026 | $1.8M - - - - | $0.1M | $0.3M | $0.2M - | $0.3M - - | $0.8M | $0.2M | $1.0M | $0.2M - | $0.1M | $0.1M | $0.8M - 2027 - | $2.3M - - - | $0.1M | $0.1M | $1.3M | $0.2M Total Use of Reserve 2023-2027 | $10.0M | $6.0M | $3.5M | $3.0M | $4.0M Total Transfers in 2023-2027 | $3.2M | $3.4M | $3.6M | $3.8M | $4.0M Net Transfers - | $6.8M - | $2.6M + | $0.1M + | $0.8M + | $0.0M Village Parking Reserve Fund Section 525 of the Local Government Act permits a local government to collect a payment in lieu of off-street parking as a condition of a building permit. These payments must be placed in a reserve. Such payments were deposited to the District’s Village Parking Reserve, established under Bylaw No. 3631, the “Parking Reserves Fund Establishment Bylaw, 1989”. Alternative Transportation Infrastructure Reserve Fund After the establishment of the District’s Village Parking Reserve, legislation was enacted to allow Council to use the reserve for transportation infrastructure supporting walking, bicycling, and public transit, in addition to the provision of new off-street parking. The District then created its Alternative Transportation Infrastructure reserve pursuant to Bylaw No. 4422, the “Alternative Transportation Infrastructure Reserve Fund Establishment Bylaw, 2008”. 91 2023-2027 Financial Plan Infrastructure Renewal Reserve This reserve was established by administrative practice and not by bylaw. The District established this reserve through budget deliberations in 2017. The City receives approximately | $800k in gas tax funds via the Union of BC Municipalities on an annual basis. These funds are deposited into the infrastructure renewal reserve. Furthermore, the annual Financial Plan allocates property tax funded transfers to this reserve. In 2019, Council directed that property taxes be increased by 2% per year so that an annual transfer could be established. The Infrastructure Renewal Reserve funded projects 2023-2027 include: Project/Program Road Restoration Uplands Sewer Separation Storm Sewer Rehabilitation Facilities Marina Transportation Safety Improvement Active Transportation Parks and Recreation Carnarvon Park Design Other Watermain Replacement Sewer Main Rehabilitation 2023 | $3.6M | $2.4M | $1.5M | $1.9M | $0.8M | $0.5M | $0.4M | $0.6M | $0.7M | $0.4M - - 2024 | $2.5M - | $1.5M | $0.4M | $0.3M | $0.6M | $0.2M | $1.3M - | $0.3M - - 2025 | $2.5M - | $1.6M | $0.4M | $0.4M | $0.6M - | $1.7M - | $0.4M | $2.6M - 2026 | $2.5M - | $1.6M | $0.4M | $0.2M | $0.6M | $0.2M | $1.0M 2027 | $2.5M - | $1.6M | $0.4M - | $0.6M | $0.2M | $2.1M | $0.3M | $2.6M | $0.2M - - | $2.0M Total Use of Reserve 2022-2026 | $12.8M | $7.1M | $10.2M | $9.4M | $9.6M Total Transfers in 2023-2027 | $6.7M | $7.6M | $7.3M | $8.9M | $9.6M Net Transfers - | $6.1M - | $0.5M - | $2.9M - | $0.5M - M Legacy Trust The Legacy Trust consists of various bequests made to the Municipality for specific purposes, such as improvements to the Seniors’ Activity portion of the Monterey Centre or the Public Art Fund. Tod House Trust The Tod House Trust was established to fund repairs to the historic residence at 2564 Heron Street, which was jointly owned by the Municipality and the Province. In 2008, the Province gave its share to Oak Bay, but only “for so long as the land is used for the specific purpose of managing the Tod House Heritage Site”. Correspondence with the Province suggests that if the property use were to change, the District will pay to the Province 50% of the market value of the property at the time that its use changed. The Trust is built up from the net rental revenue. In 2022, the Trust fund balance was used to fund capital renovations on the building. Annual net rents (rental income less annual maintenance) are deposited to the credit of this Trust fund. 92 2023-2027 Financial Plan Upland Sewer Separation Gas Tax Reserve Fund The District has accumulated and set aside | $6.1M in gas tax funds specifically for the Uplands sewer separation project. These funds were classified as a liability in the District’s financial statements due to the public nature of the commitment to this specific project until December 13, 2021. At the December 13, 2021 Regular Meeting of Council, Council adopted the following resolutions: “THAT the Gas Tax funds dedicated to the Uplands Sewer Separation Project, found in Note 3 of the District's Financial Statements, be disencumbered and be made available for general infrastructure expenditures per the terms of the 2014 - 2024 Community Works Agreement; AND FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to dedicate a portion of its property tax funded Infrastructure Renewal Reserve to the Uplands Sewer Separation Project (subject to Provincial grant approval) in the 2022-2026 Financial Plan.” Subsequent to this resolution, funds in the Uplands Sewer Separation Gas Tax Reserve were transferred to the District’s Infrastructure Renewal Reserve and were made available for general infrastructure renewal. A portion of the District’s other funds in the Infrastructure Renewal Reserve has been dedicated to the Uplands Sewer Separation project in the 2023- 2027 Financial Plan. Debt Management – Five-Year Forecast The District may choose to incur debt to finance capital expenditures. The Community Charter and Municipal Liabilities Regulation establishes debt limits for the District. The maximum amount of debt a municipality may undertake is subject to the liability servicing limit. A municipality may not incur debt if the total annual debt servicing cost is greater than 25% of the annual controllable sustainable revenues. Municipal long-term borrowing in BC must occur through the Municipal Finance Authority (MFA), and the financing must be undertaken by the municipality’s regional district. This legislated relationship creates a joint and several liability between the regional district members. The MFA has the legislated authority to levy taxation on all taxable properties within BC. These factors create a strong institutional, governance framework that helps the MFA retain a triple-A credit rating and exceptionally lowering borrowing costs on behalf of BC municipalities. When municipalities borrow, principal payments are invested by the MFA. Investment earnings are returned to the borrowing municipality via reduced principal payments. For instance, in 2004, the District borrowed | $4.7M to upgrade the Oak Bay Rec Centre, with debt forecast to be paid off in 2023. Over the 20 years, the District’s debt principal will have been reduced by approximately | $1.86M. These debt principal reductions are referred to as “actuarial adjustments”. 93 2023-2027 Financial Plan In the 2023 – 2027 Financial Plan, the District’s annual controllable sustainable revenues will exceed | $50M, making its annual liability servicing limit approximately | $12.5M. Annual debt servicing costs are expected to exceed | $3M which amounts to approximately 21.1% of the District’s liability servicing limit if the District proceeds with proposed borrowing outlined in the Financial Plan. Debt payments including interest and principal for the next five years are forecasts as follows: Year Beg. Balance New Debt* End. Balance | $Principal | $Interest* | $Total Pmts. | $Actuarial % Liability Servicing Limit** 2022 | $703,495 2023 2024 | $360,328 | $- 2025 | $7,817,800 - - | $8M | $7M | $360,328 | $142,594 | $134,378 | $276,972 | $200,573 - | $- | $142,594 | $134,378 | $276,972 | $217,734 | $182,200 | $306,000 | $488,200 | $- | $14,471,600 | $341,700 | $573,000 | $915,100 | $4,500 2026 | $14,471,600 | $20M | $33,661,200 | $797,200 | $1,337,400 | $2,134,600 | $13,200 2027 | $33,661,200 | $15M | $47,488,800 | $1,138,900 | $1,910,400 | $3,049,300 | $33,500 2.3% 2.2% 3.8% 6.7% 15.2% 21.1% * Debt interest rate is assumed to be 3.83% which is the indicative 10 year rate posted by the Municipal Finance Authority at the time this was written (February 2023). Debt amortization is assumed to be 30 years. Actuarial capitalization rate assumed 2.5%. **Assumes a 2.5% annual increase to controllable sustainable revenues The SIR Plan estimates that the District will incur | $1.3B in infrastructure replacement costs between 2022 and 2121. Approximately 36% of this (or | $469.7M) is forecasted to occur over the next 25 years. The forecasts indicate that even with rapidly increasing reserve contribution funding, the District will need to incur between | $175M and | $220M to replace its infrastructure between 2026 and 2076. 94 2023-2027 Financial Plan Approval of the Electors Local governments may undertake long-term capital borrowing through a loan authorization bylaw. The bylaw must include the purpose of the borrowing, the maximum amount to be borrowed, and the maximum duration of the borrowing; for regional district loans the specific service that the loan relates to must also be specified. All loan authorization bylaws must receive approval of the Inspector of Municipalities before any borrowing can be done. In most cases, approval of the electors (municipalities) or participating area approval (regional districts) is required before the bylaw can be adopted. Per the Municipal Liabilities Regulation, approval of the electors is not required so long as the annual cost of debt servicing does not exceed 5% of annual controllable sustainable revenues. It is estimated that the District can issue an additional | $40.9M in debt before exceeding the Approval-free Liability Zone as calculated below. The 2023-2027 Financial Plan proposes issuing | $49M in new debt, thereby exceeding the Approval-free Liability Zone. Estimated annual controllable sustainable revenues 5% Assumed long term interest rate though MFA Assumed actuarial adjustment capitalization rate Gross debt required for additional | $1,767,200 annual debt servicing | $50.0M | $2,500,000 3.83% 2.50% | $40,931,510 95 2023-2027 Financial Plan 96 2023-2027 Financial Plan Corporate Administration Capital Plan Electronic Document Management System An EDMS will efficiently and systematically manage the District’s electronic and paper documents throughout the life cycle of the document (from creation to destruction). Records will be shared with all individuals who need access, and it will support the automatic enforcement of consistent policies and styles across the District, as well as ensure that Oak Bay is following Provincial and Federal legislation. As the EDMS project progresses and electronic records are more readily accessible, it will allow the District to reduce the physical space required to store paper documents and physical records and will keep vital records safe from physical hazards like fire, floods, or other damage. Website Upgrade (carry forward) The current municipal website is a key tool for citizen communication and public engagement but needs revision. This project would upgrade the website to refresh the look and feel, improve navigation, and optimize search capabilities, as well as provide for content management functionality. This project will support communications and service excellence and address a recommendation to invest in the website from the Mayor’s Task Force on Public Engagement. Phase 2 of this project proposes the development of an internal intranet for staff use. Project scoping of Phase 2 has not been fully developed. This project was deferred until 2023 and the project budget has been increased by | $60,000 to accommodate the upgrade of the Parks, Recreation, and Culture website. The current municipal website is a key tool for citizen communication and public engagement but needs revision 97 2023-2027 Financial Plan Finance and IT Capital Plan IT Project Management Division This division was created in late 2020. The majority of costs incurred in this division are for staffing and the remainder is for software acquisition and consulting. The leadership team is responsible for prioritizing the activities in this division, as it is intended to support corporate operations and Council strategic goals. Network Switch and Other IT Hardware This capital project includes the following multi-year components: Position 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Network Switch Replacement | $88,000 Firewall | $7,200 Phone System Upgrade (carry-over) | $60,000 Uninterrupted Power Supply | $8,100 | $5,800 Servers Backups | $60,400 Wireless Access Points | $60,000 Fibre Optics Contingency Total | $10,000 | $5,000 | $5,000 | $5,000 | $8,500 | $17,000 | $13,200 | $45,000 | $20,000 | $147,000 | $22,000 | $112,000 | $117,200 | $20,000 98 2023-2027 Financial Plan PC Hardware Replacement The Information Technology (IT) Division deploys and maintains over 250 pieces of hardware for over 300 users. This inventory is valued at nearly | $250,000 and does not include printers or network hardware. Staff have established annual reserve contributions so that the financial impact of hardware replacement is not volatile. In 2020, the PC Hardware Replacement program was accelerated, funded primarily by savings in the Network Hardware replacement capital program. This was necessary to support a shift to remote working, as well as security patching and a unified support model. This inventory is valued at nearly | $250,000 and does not include printers or network hardware New PC Hardware for new Employees The District has approved several new employee positions since the 2022 Financial Plan including several Engineering Capital programming staff. Furthermore, there are several positions proposed in the 2023-2027 Financial Plan. The District’s PC Replacement fund is reserved for the replacement of existing hardware, not the purchase of new hardware for new positions. Asset Management Software Phase 1: Scoping In conjunction with the Comprehensive Asset Management Plan, this project would fund a scoping exercise for the purchase and implementation of Asset Management Software. An organization’s asset management needs are unique and complex and must be harmonized with other Enterprise Resource Planning software and existing service levels. 99 2023-2027 Financial Plan Facilities Capital Plan Public Works Yard Improvements This project would see repairs to the: • • • Storage housing area, Salt storage housing area, and Garbage compactor bin concrete base. All areas are at end-of-life and failing. Repairs are short term fixes to extend life five to 10 years. 100 2023-2027 Financial Plan Public Heat / Air Exchange (new) Public Works Heat/Air Exchanger is needed as the current unit is well past end-of-life. Ongoing failures occur and mechanical engineers have been called five times over the last year. As the unit parts in need of repair are now obsolete and unobtainable, failures will continue to occur and replacement is recommended. Recycle Yard Fencing (new) This project would see the fence at the Public Works Recycle area upgraded to a sound dampening concrete fence. In order to install this fencing, the retaining wall will need to be rebuilt. Engineered design and/or options analysis needs to be completed before construction starts. Park’s Roof (new) The low sloped conventional Styrene-Butadiene-Styrene (SBS) membrane roof on the Workshop/Cafeteria is an older roof system in service for 25 years. The SBS membrane surface is in poor condition, ridged, and is experiencing granule loss as well as ponding in the centre. The insulation is wet from previously water ingress events. The SBS membrane is nearing the end of its expected service life of 25 to 30 years and should be replaced as soon as possible. Marina Structural Repairs (carry-over) The District-owned (and leased out) Marina buildings need ongoing maintenance to keep them operational. The Marina facilities are currently leased to Oak Bay Marine Group Ltd. The lease expired at the end of 2022 and was renewed for an additional five years. A recently completed draft Facility Condition report identifies capital maintenance needs of the facility. Capital maintenance was deferred until 2023. It is unlikely that these capital maintenance items will occur until further decisions are made about the future of Turkey Head. Feasibility Study – Firehall/Police Station (new) This project originates from the Facilities Master Plan and would procure a feasibility study to review requirements, identify stakeholders, define future requirements, define options, analyze options against criteria, and develop next steps for the replacement of the Protective Services building. Firehall Heat Pump (new) The Fire Hall has an existing air conditioner (A/C), installed in 1999, that services the main office area. This A/C unit is inefficient, is beyond its useful life, and is no longer manufactured. Parts for repairs and maintenance are reportedly no longer available. The Fire Hall is heated by a natural gas boiler installed in 1990, which circulates hot water to radiators throughout the hall. The sleeping quarters and training room, located on the upper floor of the building, have no A/C and during the summer months it gets uncomfortably warm and is not suitable for sleeping. With hotter average annual temperatures, this issue is expected to only get worse as the building has very poor insulation. As the Fire Hall is a Heritage building, options to replace the roofing material with a high albedo material to reflect the heat and reduce the solar gain is not possible. Windows are also single pane and ineffective at keeping the daytime heat out of the space. 101 2023-2027 Financial Plan Firehall Washrooms (new) The Fire Hall was constructed in 1938 and operates with the original sink, toilet, and shower access and layout (one room containing two common sinks, two individual toilet stalls, and two individual showers with an open/common change area). These are the only toilets and showers in the Fire Hall, supporting a mixed-gender workforce (currently 26 uniformed members along with two civilian employees, the department has previously employed one female firefighter and aspires to support a workforce representative of the community). When staff utilize the shower/s, the only door to access the washroom is usually locked, which prevents all other staff from accessing the sinks, toilets, or shower/s. Staff must wait until the door is unlocked or utilize the Parks public washroom at Firefighters Park, which creates response delays for in-service staff. Prior to leaving fire incidents and some other structural calls, crews perform a gross (Level 1) decontamination of their equipment and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE i.e., Turn Out Gear) at the scene to leave as many contaminants at the scene as possible. Once crews return to the station, they immediately deep clean/decontaminate their apparatus and equipment and restore the vehicle to full response readiness. Then, all crew exposed to contaminants (i.e., smoke, fumes) are expected to shower and change uniforms. This is an industry standard practice and supports the health and safety of staff by reducing the occurrence of occupational/presumptive cancers. There are washroom re-design options available within the existing washroom footprint for the creation of a single gender-neutral shower/change area, single gender-neutral toilet and sink, and a single gender-neutral toilet, sink, and shower/change area (resulting in two people able to shower and keep one toilet and sink available as each is self-contained and private/secure). Facilities General Capital Program (new) This capital program would be for general capital maintenance on existing facilities and would be funded by the infrastructure renewal reserve. 1538 Monterey Avenue On January 23, 2023, Council passed the following resolution: “THAT staff be directed to initiate necessary building renovations and a rezoning process for 1538 Monterey Avenue to accommodate offices for municipal staff until sufficient office space is available in other municipal facilities, recognizing that in the longer term, other options remain for the property.” The project budget includes the cost to proceed with urgent repairs to stop further deterioration as well as costs to achieve occupancy and commercial conversion requirements. Tod House Feasibility Study A feasibility study for Tod House is identified as a Year One activity in the facilities road map. Staff will ensure an options analysis and service level summary are completed so guidance about the long term plans for Tod House can be sought from Council. All crew exposed to contaminants ... are expected to shower and change uniforms 102 2023-2027 Financial Plan Municipal Hall Exterior Washrooms The under-slab plumbing for the two Municipal Hall Public Washrooms has eroded and collapsed leading to regular backups. The washrooms are also difficult to clean and susceptible to vandalism and graffiti as there are no floor drains. The project would involve the gutting of the two washrooms to be able to jackhammer the concrete floors (some excavation may also be required along the exterior sidewalk where the lines run to Oak Bay Ave) and replace all under-slab plumbing. Reconstruction of the washrooms would utilize highly durable vandalism-resistant fixtures, materials, and finishes. We would take the opportunity to upgrade the washrooms to the most current barrier-free accessibility standards such as auto-door openers and hands-free fixtures. Feasibility Studies – Monterey Apartments/Library, Public Works, Recreation Centres, and Municipal Hall These projects originate from the Facilities Master Plan and would procure a feasibility study to review requirements, identify stakeholders, define future requirements, define options, analyze options against criteria, and develop next steps for these facilities. 103 2023-2027 Financial Plan Police Department Capital Plan Police Vehicle Replacement The Police Department maintains a small fleet of patrol vehicles and administrative vehicles. The replacement cycle of these vehicles ranges from six to 10 years. The department is reviewing options for deploying reduced emission vehicles. Total cost of the vehicles includes manufacturing and transportation as well as outfitting with equipment and branding. Police Computer Equipment Replacement IT for the District’s police force is managed by the Saanich Police Department (SPD). The SPD advises an IT equipment replacement plan, including equipment expenditures forecasted to be approximately | $280,000 over the next five years. Traffic Enforcement Equipment The Police Department maintains a small annual budget to replace traffic enforcement equipment to meet the priority of Traffic Safety. Police Firearms The department’s handguns are overdue for replacement and have reached the point where the armourers are having difficulty sourcing replacement parts. The usual lifecycle for police handguns is about 10 years. This budget includes the amounts for new handguns and holsters. Police Building Repairs The Police Department operates out of an aging facility and plans for pending maintenance work and building enhancements to allow for safe and efficient use of space. 104 2023-2027 Financial Plan Fire Department Capital Plan 105 2023-2027 Financial Plan Engine with Light Rescue (carry-over) This capital project would replace the District’s 1990 Fire Engine (Engine) with a new National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and Underwriter’s Laboratories of Canada (ULC) compliant Engine. The primary standards that govern the design, maintenance, performance, and replacement lifecycles for motorized fire apparatus are ULC S515, NFPA 1901, and Canadian Fire Underwriters Survey. Under these standards, Engines and Quints are permitted to operate in a primary capacity for 15 years and have a reserve capacity of five years. Thus a 20-year maximum service lifecycle is the industry standard. The 1990 Engine reached the end of its service lifecycle in February of 2010. This Engine is now 10 years past due for replacement. Consequently, no credit is extended towards the District’s current Fire Underwrite Survey (FUS) Grading. When current procurement and build times within the fire apparatus industry are considered, it is projected this Engine will not be replaced until late 2022. Delaying this purchase will negatively impact the District’s current FUS Grading, resulting in an increased financial cost of fire insurance for residents, businesses, and institutions. Site Preparation: Portable Apparatus Bay (carry-over) This capital budget funds the installation of a leased portable apparatus bay, and the renovation of a 1963-era apparatus bay door. The initial capital funding will be used to prepare for and install the portable apparatus bay while improving the apparatus bay door. After the initial installation and renovation, monthly lease payments will require ongoing funding. Leasing a portable apparatus storage bay will create space for a modern 100+ foot quint designed to meet the needs of the community. The dynamics of the legacy 1938/1962 Oak Bay Fire Department (OBFD) station have created apparatus design issues for the past 30 years. Both the 1990 Engine and the 2002 Quint were designed to fit into the station rather than be optimized to serve the community. The fire station is well beyond its useful lifecycle, however replacement will take time. The addition of the portable apparatus bay and renovation of the door will buy the District time to plan for replacement. The current lease option of the portable apparatus bay provides financial flexibility and will allow the District to allocate capital towards the renewal of the fire fleet, ensuring excellent service delivery. Leasing allows the District to consider the long-term plan for the fire station. The portable apparatus storage carries a number of lease buy out options. Ladder Truck with Heavy Rescue Capabilities The capital budget would fund the replacement of the 2002 68-foot Quint with a new modern NFPA and ULC compliant 100+ foot Quint in 2022. The primary standards that govern the design, maintenance/ performance, and replacement lifecycles for Engines are ULC S515, NFPA 1901, and the Canadian Fire Underwriters Survey. Under these standards, Quints are permitted to operate in a primary capacity for 15 years and a reserve capacity for an additional five years, with a maximum service lifecycle of 20 years. This is permitted as long as the prescribed preventative maintenance and performance testing is completed and documented throughout the life of the apparatus. 106 2023-2027 Financial Plan The 2002 Quint will reach the end of its service lifecycle in July of 2022. This 2002 Quint is the only Aerial Device serving Oak Bay. Due to the age of the 1990 Engine, the Quint is also the only backup Engine serving Oak Bay. Considering current procurement and build times, it is likely this Quint will not be replaced until early to mid-2022. Delaying this purchase beyond the 2022-23 budget years could negatively impact the current Fire Insurance Grading and is likely to increase the financial cost of fire insurance for residents, businesses, and institutions within the District. The OBFD fleet has not been expanded since 1962. Due to its small size, it simply lacks the capacity to compensate for an Engine or Quint reaching the end of its service lifecycle. Larger Fire departments have additional capacity within their fleets to negate this type of compression. The lean nature of the OBFD makes it critical FUS replacement schedules are judiciously maintained. Compliance with these standards will manage fire insurance costs and protect the community from undue risk and liability associated with operating expired fire equipment. This purchase would result in the current 68-foot aerial ladder truck being replaced with a 100-foot ladder truck. The current 2002 Quint had to be built with a 75-foot aerial ladder to accommodate fire station limitations. When the 2002 Quint arrived, it did not fit lengthwise into the apparatus bay. Unfortunately, the solution was to physically cut down the ladder to make it fit, leaving it with a total length of 68-feet. The net change from 85 feet to 68 feet represented a 20% reduction in the overall reach. Investment in a new Engine and new 100+ foot Quint to meet community needs is critical. To accommodate the 100+ foot Quint, new apparatus storage is required. The new apparatus storage adds approximately 17.5% in life-cycle costs, but the Quint would have an additional 47% servicing potential. The 100ft ladder would also assist the District in maintaining strong relationships with the three core municipalities of Victoria, Saanich, and Esquimalt. The OBFD fleet has not been expanded since 1962 Photo Courtesy of Spartan Fire Apparatus 107 2023-2027 Financial Plan Thermal Imaging Protective Equipment (carry-over) Thermal Imaging Cameras (TICs) are a significant expenditure and have been integrated into the equipment reserve-funded replacement program by staff. TICs provide firefighters the gift of sight in dark and smoky conditions and are arguably the single most important advancement in the global firefighting industry in the past 20 years. TICs expedite search and rescue, as well as fire attack, when seconds count. This Capital Project will allow the OBFD to ensure the replacement of this critical safety equipment and manage health and safety over the long term. Over the past 20 years, the use of lightweight synthetic composites in building construction materials and furnishings has created an extremely challenging fire environment. Fires in 2023 do not ‘burn hotter’ than in the past, instead today’s fires reach peak temperatures more rapidly, generating extremely dark toxic smoke conditions quickly and expediting structural collapse. TICs allow firefighters to work efficiently in these extreme conditions. TIC technology is constantly advancing and replacement should occur every five years. By reinvesting in state-of-the-art TICs the District will be making significant strides towards meeting this evolving threat and optimizing firefighter effectiveness. 108 2023-2027 Financial Plan The change ... is intended to provide the fire department with a more appropriate vehicle Electric Pickup Truck This Capital budget will fund the replacement of the 2008 Toyota Camry Sedan (Camry) in 2023 with a new Hybrid or true Electric 4x4 Pick-Up Truck (Pick-Up). The change from a Camry to a Pick-Up is intended to provide the fire department with a more appropriate vehicle. The Camry currently serves as a logistics and on-call duty officer vehicle. The Camry is a medium sized four-door sedan-style passenger car not suited for use in the fire service. The Camry does not have an NFPA 1901 compliant lights and sirens safety package. A new Pick-Up would be NFPA 1901 compliant, have added safety features, and be much more useful. In addition to the fact that the Camry is not suited for the role that it currently fills, it is starting to show its age. The vehicle is a hybrid but it is first generation technology and significant repairs to the battery system are looming. By the time of replacement, the Camry will be 15 years old and it will have an estimated 150,000 to 160,000 kilometers. Furthermore, the lack of an NFPA 1901 compliant lights and sirens package restricts it to non-emergency use. A new Pick-Up will provide a vehicle that is much safer, more effective, able to function post-disaster, and contribute towards the District’s environmental stewardship. OBFD staff are currently researching replacement options and anticipate that a true Electric Pick-Up will be the best option. Mobile Data Terminals (carry-over) Replacement of existing Mobile Data Terminals on Fire Apparatus as they are at the end of their service life. These Data Terminals provide critical information regarding location, nature, and details of emergency calls and are integral to the computerized dispatch of fire apparatus. Technical Rescue Protective Equipment The two primary standards that govern the use, care, and replacement of Technical Rescue Equipment (TRE) are NFPA 1983 and WorkSafe BC Part 32. These standards require all “soft- goods” be replaced after five years of active service. They also require replacement if TRE is physically damaged or contaminated with chemical or biological substances. Soft goods comprise all harnesses, ropes, webbing, and anchor straps, while hardware represents carabiners, pulleys, belay devices, tripods, stretchers, and all the supporting safety equipment. TRE replacement has been integrated into the fire equipment replacement plan and funded by annual reserve contributions. Automated External Defibrillator Replacement The OBFD has an inventory of four Automatic External Defibrillators (AEDs) and would like to increase this inventory to five. AEDs are a critical lifesaving device for Oak Bay residents, as delivered through the medical First Responder Program. This equipment is carried on frontline fire apparatus and increasing inventory will allow support vehicles such as Fire Prevention to be equipped and more accessible to the community. The four AEDs in service have reached the end of their service life and require replacement in 2023. 109 2023-2027 Financial Plan Training Room Modernization Until June of 2022, the fire department training room did not have any supporting technology and remained nearly unchanged from its 1938 origins. Municipal network access (WIFI and hardwired) was installed in 2022 but did not include supporting equipment. Supporting technology includes a computer and audio/visual hardware such as large screen monitor, phone/s, conferencing system etc. This equipment is considered the minimum requirement to support department training activities that are heavily reliant on hardware, web-based software, online fire service related curriculum, and the departments Incident Command System interactive training platform, which is currently inaccessible in the existing training room. Updating will provide for virtual learning opportunities and communications with our neighboring departments (i.e., Mutual Aid partners) that we have not previously had the ability to support. Gas Detective Protective Equipment Gas Detectors are one of the most effective tools for protecting first responders from unseen and unknown atmospheric hazards. They provide early detection and allow firefighters to take precautionary steps to protect themselves and the residents they serve. This Capital Project will ensure the replacement of this critical safety equipment and manage health and safety over the long term. There is a continual need to actively manage Gas Detectors to protect the health and safety of firefighters. Wear and tear on the internal electronic components of Gas Detectors at incidents and during training are major stressors. The electrochemical sensors within Gas Detectors are always “working” as they are constantly exposed to the atmosphere. These factors are compounded when continual advancements in technology render legacy Gas Detectors obsolete, and after five years of service replacement is warranted to ensure reliability and optimum performance. By reinvesting in Gas Detectors the District will be able to maintain this critical safety equipment. The life-cycle costs have been integrated into the District’s equipment replacement plan and will be funded by annual reserve contributions. By reinvesting in Gas Detectors the District will be able to maintain this critical safety equipment 110 2023-2027 Financial Plan Engineering Services Capital Plan Transportation Safety Improvements This program aims to deliver projects to improve safety for all road users within the District. Projects delivered under this program include crosswalks, traffic-calming initiatives, intersection improvements, and other safety-related capital works. Road Reconstruction Program The aim of the Road Reconstruction Program is to develop a sustainable road surface rehabilitation program that achieves a specific service level while maintaining best value for money. The District’s Pavement Management Study, completed in 2013, identified over | $2M in road rehabilitation that needs to occur annually in order to maintain the pavement conditions identified in that year. Storm Sewer Rehabilitation This program captures the refurbishment or replacement of Storm Sewer Mains that have reached end of service life. Based on asset management program targets, the program gradually increases capital expenditures for Storm Sewer Rehabilitation to | $1.1M per year. The program has been underfunded in recent years: the 2016 budget was | $212,000, the 2017 budget was | $117,000 (funded from reserves), and the 2018 budget was | $265,000. 111 2023-2027 Financial Plan Consistent and predictable funding for Storm Sewer Rehabilitation is essential to ensure capital projects are done efficiently and with best value for money. This funding commitment allows for a more cost-effective planned approach to repairs and rehabilitation, as opposed to a more expensive and reactive approach to repairs. Uplands Sewer Separation (Partially Grant Funded) The Uplands neighbourhood currently has a single sewer system that accommodates both sanitary sewage and stormwater flows. During heavy rainfall, the storm water volume exceeds the capacity of the system and a combination of stormwater and raw sewage discharges into the shallow ocean waters at the Rutland Road and Humber Road pump stations. Separating combined sewers and eliminating overflows at the Humber and Rutland pump stations is necessary under BC’s Municipal Wastewater Regulation. In October 2016, Council committed to a plan to separate combined sewers in the Uplands. The plan involves constructing approximately 5km of new storm mains, progressively diverting stormwater flows from homes and catch basins to the new storm sewers. This plan has the added benefit of reducing the volume of stormwater in the sanitary sewer system, enabling the District to take positive steps towards meeting its sewer flow commitments under the Core Area Liquid Waste Management Plan. Refreshed estimates for the project were prepared in early 2022: Humber Construction Rutland Detailed Design Rutland Construction Total Class B Class B Class C - | $8,832,000 | $415,000 | $16,347,300 | $25,594,300 The District has submitted a third application to the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Grant Program (ICIP). This program provides up to 73.33% of funding for eligible projects.

Street and Intersection Pole Replacement Program (new) This project will identify and replace end-of-lifespan electrical poles, and to develop plans to replace larger contiguous areas of aged poles. 112 2023-2027 Financial Plan Electrical Street Light Kiosks – Uplands and Rutland (new) The Uplands streetlighting system power supply connects from BC Hydro to Oak Bay at two underground vaults. These vaults are old and do not meet current standards. The problem with the vaults is that they are confined spaces and have water infiltration, and the high voltage wiring has poor insulation and connections. After the vaults, power for the Uplands streetlights is transmitted via an underground beeswax-wrapped 112-year-old copper line. On this line failures are starting to occur more often as it is at the end of its life and needs to be replaced. Currently Oak Bay’s Electricians have to enter the vault as many as 12 times a month to reset or shutdown the system to perform repairs. Above ground kiosks meet today’s standards. McNeill Bay/McMicking Point Foreshore Erosion Mitigation This project includes two separate studies identifying options for the mitigation of ocean erosion on McNeill Bay and McMicking Point. The project will incorporate considerations from the new Sea Level Rise Study. Year Component 2021 Project definition, concept planning, public engagement 2022 Preliminary and detailed design 2023 Construction Amount | $30,000 | $50,000 | $1,200,000 The construction costs are unknown at this time and will be better defined once detailed design work is complete. This new infrastructure would require an increase in the ongoing operating budget. Foreshore Infrastructure The natural areas along the foreshore of the District—including Willows Beach, Oak Bay, McNeill Bay, and others — are extremely popular for walkers. The metal railings used for pedestrian safety in these areas are exposed to the elements, especially salt-water spray, resulting in accelerated corrosion and failure. As part of an ongoing safety program, the District conducts periodic maintenance to refurbish or replace these railings. This annual program also addresses minor repairs to stairs and other foreshore access points. Bowker Creek Walkway Railings (new) There are approximately 450 metres of chain railings along the Bowker Creek walkway, which are in an advanced state of disrepair. The chain railings are not up to a safe standard and should be replaced with a metal three-bar railing. Public Works Vehicle and Equipment Replacement Much of the District’s fleet is due for replacement and will be replaced in the next five years. However, reserve-funding levels are believed to be sustainable for the long term. For further information on the asset replacement funding, please see the State of Asset Replacement Funding section of this Financial Plan. 113 2023-2027 Financial Plan This will significantly cut down on how much time it takes to inspect our pipes Engineering General Equipment Replacement This project budget includes the purchase of a SL-RAT device and a Robotic Total Station. The SL-RAT device will allow Public Works staff to quickly assess whether a given segment of the sewer or storm drain is blocked. The device consists of a transmitter and a receiver, which send an audible pulse down the pipe and measure the quality of the signal. The device then assigns the pipe a score from 0-10 based on how much of the signal made it to the other end of the pipe. This will significantly cut down on how much time it takes to inspect our pipes, because if a pipe scores seven or higher there is no need for further action such as flushing or root cutting. The Robotic Total Station will replace the District’s aging total station with a more modern unit. As a bonus, the new total station will be robotic, which means most surveys will only require one staff member. Before, we needed two staff members to survey with the total station. 114 2023-2027 Financial Plan Sewer Utility Capital Plan Sewer Main Rehabilitation and Manhole Replacement As part of sanitary sewer asset management, Engineering Services replace or refurbish portions of the approximately 100 km of sanitary sewer mains. These main replacements are typically done as conventional excavations or, if possible, via less disruptive and less expensive trench-less rehabilitation, such as cured-in-place pipe lining. The aim of this work is to install new pipe or extend the life span of an existing pipe for another 50-70 years. There are 1,316 sewer manholes or utility access holes. District staff either refurbish, replace, or install new manholes on a regular basis to ensure the sanitary sewer system can be maintained and operated effectively. Engineering Services replace or refurbish portions of the ... 100 km of sanitary sewer mains 115 2023-2027 Financial Plan Water Utility Capital Plan Watermain and Hydrant Replacement A portion of the District’s 115 km of water main are rehabilitated or replaced each year as part of the Water Distribution System Master Plan. The 2023 plan for water main rehabilitation represents a significant increase in output. This change is due to the significant backlog of water infrastructure work identified in the District’s asset management work between 2016 and 2019. The Water Master Plan, followed by the staff’s significant work in 2020 to flesh out a more robust capital improvement program for water infrastructure, enables the District to accelerate much needed water main replacements. This acceleration represents the first step in a multi- year program to address the maintenance backlog and sustain the current levels of service for water distribution. The District has 494 hydrants to service firefighting needs. Each year, hydrants are replaced, or new hydrants installed, as part of the annual capital refurbishment plan, which falls within the Water Distribution Master Plan. The Water Master Plan ... enables the District to accelerate much needed water main replacements Water Distribution System Remote Monitoring System This project would include the installation of new Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition remote monitoring equipment at the Pressure Reducing Valves at Lansdowne and Middowne stations to properly monitor and control water pressure in several of Oak Bay’s pressure zones and identify water losses. This work will include longer-term options analysis and costing for system-wide remote monitoring upgrades. North Oak Bay Pump Station Consolidation and Water Main Upgrades This multi-year project comes from a major recommendation from the Water Supply System Master Plan. Currently in the options analysis/project definition phase, the aim of the project is to define a consolidation and renewal program of several pump stations and mains in North Oak Bay. 116 2023-2027 Financial Plan Water Distribution System Studies and Capital Projects (carry-over) There are new projects that will require funding to pursue, as part of the water distribution system capital improvement program. The water distribution system capital improvement program is a result of the District’s Water Master Plan that was completed in 2020. 2024 Detailed Condition Inspections and Investigation of Backup Power, Pump Stations, and Pressure Reducing Stations (Study and Capital Project Definition) Cross-border Connection (Victoria and Oak Bay) Technical Investigation (Project Definition) Cross-border Connection (Saanich and Oak Bay) Technical Investigation (Project Definition) Water Asset Management Strategy update study 2024 Total 2025 Cost | $50,000 | $10,000 | $10,000 | $50,000 | $120,000 Cost Cross-border Connection (Victoria and Oak Bay) Implementation/Construction | $26,000 Cross-border Connection (Saanich and Oak Bay) Implementation/Construction | $200,000 2025 Total | $226,000 117 2023-2027 Financial Plan Parks, Recreation, and Culture Capital Plan Oak Bay Recreation Centre (OBRC) Facilities Maintenance This capital budget includes replacement of flooring, exterior doors, fitness centre flooring systems, exterior lighting, cedar siding, exterior painting, interior lighting, windows, and counters, along with exterior painting and tennis bubble court resurfacing. Oak Bay Recreation Centre Parking Lot Rehabilitation Options This budget is the carry-over from the parking lot repaving project in 2021. The lower parking lot was successfully repaved. The upper parking lot has not been repaved pending the review of Bowker Creek stability considerations. 118 2023-2027 Financial Plan Henderson Gym Roof Replacement This project involves replacement of the roof over the gymnasium at the Henderson Recreation Centre. Parks Facilities This capital budget includes the Anderson Hill Park kiosk and capital maintenance of Quimper Park washrooms. Carnarvon Park Building Design and Build (Updated Pricing) This project involves demolition of the old building and construction of a new two-story building, as recommended in the Carnarvon Park Master Plan. The building design would be conducted in 2024. Monterey Building Maintenance This capital budget includes the replacement of exterior and interior lighting, linoleum, automatic front doors, and flooring. OBRC Fire Alarm System This project is the lifecycle replacement of the fire alarm system currently in service at the OBRC. This is a lifecycle project for a system that was installed in 2003. The system is computer based and we’ve had some electronic equipment failures over the years. We had an issue in with a control board in 2018, the service company was able to service it but advised that this system is no longer supported in its current format, and parts are becoming increasingly hard to source. We were advised to consider upgrading soon. The system is checked and maintained annually and has held out to date, but a major component failure could potentially lead to costly emergency service. E-Bike Shelter - OBRC (new) This would be the renovation of the bike shelter area and the addition of charging stations for e-bikes. Monterey Roof This capital budget would fund the removal and replacement of all the roofing, gutter, and downspout systems at the Monterey Recreation Centre. It includes six line items in the OBPRC capital plan document scheduled for 2025. The current roofing systems were installed in 2000. A roofing audit in 2013 recommended roofing systems be replaced by 2023 if certain conditions were met at the time of report, which they were. By 2025, the systems will have reached their recommended lifespan and be several years past the date recommended in the 2013 report. The current conditions reflect the age and the gutters require regular checking and repair. Waiting too long would result in damage to wood structures underneath and lead to a significant increase in costs once exposed. Another key upgrade would be to add tie-in points and guardrails to protect staff and contractors on the roof. Henderson Building Maintenance This capital budget includes capital maintenance to the gym floor, chimney removal, millwork, and window replacement. Fitness Centre Renovation This capital budget includes capital maintenance to the gym floor, chimney removal, millwork, and window replacement. 119 2023-2027 Financial Plan Oak Bay Recreation Centre General Equipment This capital budget includes the replacement of an edger, pool filters, a boiler, ducts, a fire alarm system, floor scrubbers, pool controllers, an air compressor, air handling equipment, an ice machine, a walk-in cooler, patio furniture, and kitchen exhaust system. Oak Bay Recreation Centre Air Unit This project involves the lifecycle replacement of the desert-aire dehumidification system for the pool natatorium at the Oak Bay Recreation Centre. Parks Equipment This capital budget includes the replacement of a flagpole and a fields verticutter, and the implementation of a tree inventory system. Henderson General Equipment This capital budget includes the replacement of a bouncy castle, a boiler, heating circulation pumps, and a water heater. Monterey General Equipment This capital budget includes the replacement of exhaust fans, furnaces, a dishwasher, roof exhaust, and a fire alarm system. Oak Bay Recreation Centre Cardio Equipment Replacement This capital budget fund involves the lifecycle replacement of all cardio equipment, which includes treadmills, steppers, stationary bikes (i.e., recumbent), elliptical trainers, and hand ergometers. 120 2023-2027 Financial Plan Boiler #2 Replacement and Upgrade This project is the replacement of the secondary boiler at the OBRC. The project would ideally be a redesign of the boiler system to tie into existing and future energy saving considerations. The second boiler has been in service since 1973. It reliably does what it is required to do but is far from efficient in the process. It is dated technology, taking up a large amount of space. Ideally a new high-efficiency boiler would be put in its place, tied into current and future heat reclaim and energy saving initiatives. The existing boiler #1 would then become the standby system for emergencies. Recreational Software RFP This is the lifecycle update of the software PRC uses for managing operations and membership, processing payments, and program coordination. Solar System This project would involve the removal, disposal, and replacement of the solar system on the roof above the aquatic area of the OBRC. Ideally the project would replace the existing solar water heating system installed in 1984 with a photovoltaic system to generate electricity, or a combination panel that could generate electricity and hot water if cost effective. The existing system has been reconfigured over the years and is currently used as a domestic water pre-heat. It has become quite corroded, leaks large amounts of water, and requires significant regular maintenance for little return. It has far exceeded its lifespan and some sections are decommissioned because of failure. The surface area it occupies could be put to better use as demands from the facility have changed. Motor Control Centres This project is the replacement of the Motor Control Centers (MCC) for the OBRC. This is a lifecycle project for a system installed in 1973. The MCC’s are original equipment and are critical pieces of the electrical distribution system for the OBRC. The equipment has far exceeded its expected life, is deemed obsolete, and does not meet currents standards and codes. The switchgear is worn and does not give correct feedback. Parts are no longer available, requiring costly and time-consuming repairs when equipment fails. The switchgear is not protected from shorting and surging properly, allowing incidents to cause more damage than would be normal. The MCC was thermal scanned in 2021, and although there were only a couple minor issues, the system is so old and fragile a major event could cause severe damage to equipment and personnel, leading to a long and costly emergency shutdown. 121 2023-2027 Financial Plan Henderson/Kiwanis Park Playground Equipment This project involves replacement of the playground equipment at Henderson Park in the same location, using the same footprint. Windsor Playground This project involves replacement of the playground equipment at Windsor Park in the same location, using the same footprint. Lafayette Park Playground Equipment This project involves replacement of the playground equipment at Lafayette Park in the same location, using the same footprint. Henderson Court Resurfacing This project part of a preventative maintenance plan to and maximize the lifecycle of district assets and continue to provide safe and enjoyable experiences for users. Due to foundation movement, expansion, and contraction from the elements and weeds, staff anticipate some crack repairing using various techniques depending on the severity. Staff also anticipate replacing any damaged or worn fixtures such a poles and netting. If left too long the surface can become dangerous from slipping, increasing the risk of injury and making it harder to play on for users. To remedy this, the courts will be painted with silica-injected paint. Further, the silica-injected paint will preserve the lifespan of the courts and improve the overall appearance and value to our users. 122 2023-2027 Financial Plan Operating Impact of New Capital Services As new capital is acquired and constructed, the District is subject to increasing operating costs to maintain said capital. For example, when a road is built, the District must then maintain that road and keep it clear of debris. Furthermore, often the community forms an expectation that the capital service will continue in perpetuity, and thus the infrastructure will be replaced at the end of its life. As a result, staff endeavor to present the full life-cycle costs of capital budget items so Council may consider the entire financial impact of budget approval. Below you will find the new capital items being considered in the scope of this Financial Plan. “New” capital does not include capital expenditures for maintaining or replacing existing capital services. For instance, the replacement of an existing road is not a new capital expenditure because the ongoing operating and maintenance costs of that capital are already integrated into the operating budget. New capital includes a brand-new capital service or enhancement to existing capital services.

It does not include expenditures made for capital, on debt principal, or transfers to or from reserves. Local governments may budget for an accounting surplus or deficit but not a budget surplus or deficit. See the definition of a balanced budget. Accrual: An accounting method measuring the financial performance and position of an organization by recognizing economic events when they happen, regardless of when the related cash changes hands. For instance, revenue is recognized in the financial statements when earned, not when received. Accumulated Surplus: The accumulated surplus is a pool of accumulated funds resulting from all historical budgetary surpluses. Budgetary surpluses result in funds remaining in accumulated surplus (unappropriated) or transferred to reserve (appropriated). Appropriated: When a fund is appropriated, it is subject to certain restrictions on what the fund can be used for. Approval of the Electors: Approval of the electors is required when a local government decision may have a significant impact on the community over the longer term. Some examples are: (1) Long-term borrowing (loan authorization) for municipalities, (2) Disposal of certain utilities other than a water or sewage system, (3) Exchange or other disposal of parkland, (4) Liabilities under some types of agreement, or (5) Removing the reservation or dedication from property. Approval-free Liability Zone: The approval-free liability zone is 5% of controllable and sustainable municipal revenue. Once the total annual cost of servicing liabilities exceeds the 5% approval free limit, all subsequent borrowing must receive elector approval. Balanced Budget: A financial plan where the sum of current revenue, transfers from reserves, and debt proceeds, equals the sum of current operating expenditures, debt principal payments, and capital expenditures. Capital Asset: An asset that has physical substance, is used to supply a service, lasts longer than a year, and is not for sale in the ordinary course of operations. Capital Expenditure: The expenditure of monies for the purchase or construction of a capital asset. Deferred Revenue: Refers to payments received in advance for services which have not yet been performed. The most common form of deferred revenue in municipal accounting consists of Development Cost Charges that are advanced payments for future capital services needed because of growth. Financial Plan: This term is used interchangeably with “budget” but will also usually refer to the five-year budget bylaw. 125 2023-2027 Financial Plan Forced growth: Increased costs the District must incur to continue to provide existing services at the same service level. For instance, collective agreement increases, inflation, and contractual increases are forced growth factors. Forced growth is not increases to service delivery costs resulting from elective changes or enhancements to existing programs. Fund: A pool of money set aside for a specific purpose. FTE (Full Time Equivalent): A statistic to compare staffing levels between departments, organizations, or years. It is calculated by dividing the total number of hours that one full- time staff member would work during a year. LGDE (Local Government Data Entry): The LGDE forms provide a standardized financial measure of local government activities over the previous fiscal year. Local governments must annually submit their forms by May 15 to the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing. These forms are a standardized presentation of a local government’s financial position and activities, such as assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenditures over the course of the previous fiscal year (based on the audited financial statements). Life-Cycle Costs: Full life-cycle costs refer to the total costs incurred by a piece of capital during the entirety of its useful life. For instance, full life-cycle costs would include the acquisition or construction cost, maintenances costs, and the cost of ongoing annual repairs and maintenance for continued provision of the capital service. Liability: Liabilities are present obligations a reporting entity has to others arising from past transactions or events, the settlement of which is expected to result in the future sacrifice of economic benefit. Municipal Finance Authority (MFA): The Municipal Finance Authority of British Columbia (MFA) was created in 1970 to contribute to the financial wellbeing of local governments throughout BC. The MFA pools the borrowing and investment needs of BC communities through a collective structure and can provide a range of low cost and flexible financial services to clients equally, regardless of the size of the community. The MFA is independent from the Province of British Columbia and operates under the governance of a Board of Members appointed from the various Regional Districts within the province. New Construction Taxation Revenue: Taxation revenue resulting from taxable land or buildings not subject to taxes in the previous year. For example, newly built taxable buildings, previously exempt taxable property, newly subdivided land, or valuation increase due to zoning amendments. Official Community Plan: Under the Local Government Act Section 471, an OCP is a statement of objectives and policies to guide decisions on planning and land use management within the area covered by the plan, respecting the purposes of local government. Operating Costs: Expenses which are related to the operation of a business, or related device, component, piece of equipment, or facility. Reserve Fund: A fund established by bylaw for a specific purpose. Monies placed in a reserve fund can only be used for the purpose for which the reserve was established. 126 2023-2027 Financial Plan Revenue: Income from business services and fees. Service Plans: These plans depict the operating costs/revenues and related performance measures of a District Department. RFP: A Request For Proposal is issued at an early stage in a procurement process, where an invitation is presented for suppliers to submit a proposal on a commodity or service. SOFI (Statement of Financial Information): The SOFI is a financial statement prepared pursuant to the Financial Information Act. The SOFI contains audited financial statements, as well as other mandated schedules including the schedule of remuneration and expenses, as well as the schedule showing payments made for the provision of goods or services. Special Initiatives: One-time operating projects outside the normal course of work performed by staff. Sustainable infrastructure replacement funding: This refers to the annual funding required so an asset can be replaced at the end of its useful life without borrowing. 127 2023-2027 Financial Plan Appendix A: Special Project Descriptions Storm Sewer Master Plan (2022-2023) This Master Plan will incorporate an updated storm sewer hydraulic model and a growth capacity analysis, and current asset management and capital improvement plans. The 2021 Financial Plan approved | $150,000 spending in both 2022 and 2023. The 2023 Financial Plan proposes carry forward spending of | $225,000 in 2023. Reference: Asset Management Strategy, January 24,2019 Special Committee of the Whole Natural Assets and Green Infrastructure Scoping (new) Many of the District’s infrastructure policy objectives outlined in the OCP include the development of stormwater/rainwater management bylaws (encouraging low impact development), expansion of capital projects (including better creek-side pathways and daylighting), and consideration of the creek as a natural asset. This project would explore incorporating municipal services related to management of natural assets and green infrastructure. The intent would be to complete this work in conjunction with the Storm Water Master Plan. Reference: November 22, 2021 Council Meeting Emergency Communications Plan (carry-over) The Province is modernizing the Emergency Program Act and all the associated processes. The strategic plan for the Oak Bay Emergency Program is to enable the District to keep pace with the subsequent changes to legislated accountabilities. This budget item will be used to update emergency plans and processes, buy equipment and materials, and train staff and volunteers at a pace that enables the District to maintain a preparedness level appropriate to its size and responsibilities. It will be used in conjunction with the Program’s associated budget items and external funding opportunities. Sidewalk Patio Regulation Review (carry-over) In May 2020, the Province introduced a Temporary Expansion Service Area (TESA) to allow licensed establishments to serve customers on public property while complying with pandemic-related health orders and requiring local government approval. To support the Province’s initiative, the District developed Temporary Sidewalk and Parking Stall Patio Street Occupancy Permits to let food and liquor establishments expand onto sidewalks and roads. The TESA permits and the current Oak Bay approvals will expire on March 31, 2023. In July 2021, Council directed staff to develop a new permanent program for sidewalk and parking space patios. It was set up as one of the Strategic Priority Projects for 2022. Through the Sidewalk Patio Expansion Program project, Oak Bay is currently developing its own permanent public space patio permitting process to replace the temporary process. Existing patios will require reapplication and be subject to the new design criteria. The Patio Project started in December 2022, with consultation taking place through January and February 2023. The project is expected to be completed in the spring of 2023. (In addition, Council has also been considering further policy changes for sidewalk patios in relation to Village Area planning. This topic was added to the scope of the Village Area Planning project which is slated for the years 2023 – 2025 and this may result in further changes beyond the scope of the 2022 Sidewalk Patio Expansion Project.) 128 2023-2027 Financial Plan Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Training (carry-over) This initiative will provide training for Council and Senior Management regarding the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. Council and Staff comprehension and compliance with current FOIPPA legislation is critical in daily municipal operations. Human Resource (HR) Plan Implementation (carry-over) The purpose of the HR plan is to ensure that the District of Oak Bay has adequate human resources to meet the District’s strategic goals. It’s about ensuring that we have the right people with the right skills at the right time to deliver on Council’s priorities. It is critical that we position the District of Oak Bay as an employer of choice to attract and retain the best talent to ensure future success and sustainability. The various initiatives of the plan will focus on HR planning, attracting, and retaining great staff, as well as promoting performance excellence and a commitment to employee safety and wellness. The HR Plan has the following components, and costs: Learning and Development - Integrated into operating budget - 2021 Budget 2021 Actual 2022 Carry Over 2023 Carry Over 2024 Budget 2025 Budget Employee Engagement | $20,000 | $20,000 | $10,000 | $1,400 | $8,600 20,000 | $8,600 | $20,000 Performance Feedback and Evaluation Health and Wellness Recognition Policy Review - Integrated into operating budget - - Integrated into operating budget - | $14,000 | $14,000 | $14,000 Occupational Health and Safety | $20,000 | $10,000 | $20,000 | $20,000 Total | $64,000 | $62,600 | $62,600 | $20,000 Records Management (approved in 2021 – 2025 Financial Plan) Records Management is an integral component of municipal operations for legislative and productivity reasons. The current system needs updating to incorporate best practices, improve business processes, and ensure regulatory compliance. This initiative is a multi-year undertaking. Reference: Budget Estimates Committee, April 17, 2019 Parking Enforcement Services Review (carry-over) Parking enforcement focuses on the requirements found in the District’s Streets and Traffic Bylaw. The Bylaw traffic infraction fines have not been reviewed in over a decade. It is proposed that Council be given the opportunity to provide governance direction on enforcement policy as well as approach. The scope of this project would include: • • • • • Review and modernization of the District’s Streets and Traffic bylaw Review of existing parking enforcement hardware, software, and interdepartmental business processes Council engagement on enforcement policy and approach Council engagement on revenue targets Creation of standard operation procedures for parking enforcement 129 2023-2027 Financial Plan Occupational Disability Claims Management (new) Annually the District funds (or partially funds) numerous programs, benefits and insurance premiums related to the health and wellbeing of staff including long term disability, annual sick leave, employee assistance program, extended health care and WorkSafe BC insurance. Occupational disability management is the responsibility of management. Disability management must include thorough coordination between employees, management, premium providers, case managers, health care professionals, and unions. Failure to engage in adequate disability management can result in high WorkSafe BC premiums, low employee morale and significant productivity loss. Annually the District pays Worksafe BC premiums to provide insurance coverage for its workers. These premiums represent a significant expense in the District’s operating budget and impact all service areas. This project funds contracted disability management services. The objective of the project is to improve occupational health and safety, reduce productivity loss and reduce WorkSafe BC premiums. The project is proposed on a pilot basis. Staff are optimistic that the project will reduce WorkSafe BC premiums and add ongoing funding to increase disability management capacity from within the organization. Marina Lease Negotiations Marina Lease Negotiations and Related Feasibility and Facility (carry-over) The District of Oak Bay’s lease with the Province for the foreshore/aquatic crown lands occupied by Oak Bay Marina expired in December 2022. The Oak Bay Marina’s lease with the District of Oak Bay also expired in December 2022. Deer Management Study (new) The Ministry of Forests, Lands and Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development has provided grant funding of | $37,906 to supplement the District’s contribution of | $38,050 to continue the Oak Bay deer management research project being undertaken by the Urban Wildlife Stewardship Society (UWSS). UWSS will analyze and report on deer population response after 3 years of Immuno-contraceptive (IC) treatment by modelling population density and relative fawn abundance for 2021 and 2022. UWSS will also collect another year of data in fall 2023 to evaluate how the population is responding following a pause in IC treatment in fall 2022. 130 2023-2027 Financial Plan Parks, Recreation, and Culture Master Plan (2024) The District of Oak Bay has not undertaken the preparation of a comprehensive Parks and Recreation Master Plan that engages the community to understand their specific interests and needs. The District’s Official Community Plan recommends preparation of this Plan given the passion for parks and recreation in the community, and the need for continued upgrading and maintenance of facilities. The project’s deliverables will include: • • • • A community survey to assess existing use patterns, satisfaction, and needs in relation to parkland, sports fields, trails/paths, playgrounds, other park amenities, recreation centres, and recreation programs An analysis of existing and forecasted demographics and best practices to support the community needs analysis Identification of existing and future community needs for different types and locations of parkland, park amenities, paths/trails, recreation facilities and recreation programs, considering the needs of people of all ages and abilities Consideration of the need for upgrading the pool or other amenities at Oak Bay Recreation Centre, potentially in partnership with the School District, to satisfy the needs of students as well as all members of the community References: (1) Budget Estimates Committee, April 17, 2019, (2) Official Community Plan, 2014, Section 4.6.1 and 4.6.2 Animal Control Bylaw/Dog Off-Leash Policy The scope of this project would include a dogs-in-parks policy review as well as a broader animal control review including bylaw amendments. The Parks, Recreation and Culture department will collaborate with Corporate Administration and Strategic Initiatives to realize operational efficiencies and cost savings to streamline the process. Community engagement can be conducted with one comprehensive process instead of two separate processes. Furthermore, bylaw development can avoid multiple amendments or disjointed purposes. Urban Forest Management – Garry Oak Inventory (vary-over) Information collected, and efforts made to conduct an inventory of the Garry Oak, and associated ecosystems in Oak Bays natural areas parks will assist in the design of trail networks and provide a baseline for measuring success of restoration activities. Accumulated data is extremely useful and will be reported to the provincial and federal agencies to track the overall recovery or decline of rare plant species in both Oak Bay area and Canada’s natural parks. The data will also help establish federal funding priorities for recovery activities such as habitat restoration. CCAWG Recommendation – Coolkit Program (carry-over) The Coolkit program has been developed through the University of British Columbia (UBC) Forestry program to function as a toolkit to engage with community residents. Its focus is on impacting climate change and urban forestry; with an overall intent to engage the community in a conversation around climate action, to lead to positive action on both public and private lands. The program is designed to involve everyone from individual residents, their families, and communities, to organizations and local governments in determining what climate action they should focus on. One core element focuses on urban forestry; however it also includes items such as urban food gardens, home improvements, car-pooling, and other local forms of active transportation. The program is designed to be applicable at the neighbourhood level to achieve the greatest impact. 131 2023-2027 Financial Plan CCAWG Recommendation #4 –GHG Reduction Retrofit Program (carry-over) Recommendation #4 from the District’s Community Climate Action Working Group was to help, “create two separate programs and associated policies to accelerate GHG and energy reductions for the retrofit and adaptation of existing buildings, and for new building construction.” This recommendation is intended to increase energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in both new and existing housing stock. Programs that address new housing stock could include initiatives such as implementing higher levels of the BC Energy Step Code, developing an informational program to promote available rebates and incentives for homeowners, or developing an expedited building permit program. Budget for this project would fund a consultant to design the program, however on-going operational costs for such a program has not yet been integrated into the Financial Plan. Council Priority Projects At the February 6, 2023, Council meeting, Council received a Council Priority Project reports that included several project backgrounders requested from Council. This funding would enable that priority projects selected by Council are funded through 2025 using the Council Priorities Reserve. Staff are currently preparing a Council Priorities Plan which would detail all of the selected projects. 132 2023-2027 Financial Plan Appendix B: 2022 Preliminary Financial Results (Unaudited) 133 2023-2027 Financial Plan 134 2023-2027 Financial Plan Appendix C: Basis of Accounting and Budgeting The accounting policies of the District conform to Canadian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles for local governments and the Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared as prescribed by the Public Sector Accounting Board (PSAB) of the Canadian Institute of Chartered Professional Accountants. The District uses various funds to account for its revenues and expenditures. The revenue in each fund may be spent only for the purpose specified in the fund. Each fund belongs to one of five categories: general, parks and recreation, sewer, water, or reserve. General funds are used for general government and protective services. Recreational funds are used for the day-to-day operations of the District’s Parks, Recreation and Culture department. Water and Sewer funds are self-financed utilities, except for a general fund contribution to the sewer fund. Both utility funds are used for operating and capital purposes. Reserve funds accumulate revenue and interest that will be used to pay for major capital expenses in future years. All funds, (general, sewer utility and reserves) are accounted for on the accrual basis. Sources of revenue are recognized when earned. Revenue unearned in the current period is reported on the balance sheet as deferred revenue. 135 2023-2027 Financial Plan Appendix D: Draft Financial Plan Bylaw THE CORPORATION OF THE DISTRICT OF OAK BAY BYLAW NO. 4833 A Bylaw respecting the financial plan for the years 2023, 2024, 2025, 2026 AND 2027 The Municipal Council of The Corporation of the District of Oak Bay in open meeting assembled enacts as follows: 1.

Funding Sources 2. Property Value Tax Distribution 3. Permissive Tax Exemptions 1. Funding Sources 1.1 Revenue from Property Value Taxes - Objectives and Policies The Municipality has a property tax base within which 98.1% of the value is in the Residential class. The high percentage of Residential value, which by its nature is spread over a very large number of properties as opposed to being concentrated in a single industry or sector, enhances the dependability of the property tax as a revenue source. The higher the proportion of total revenue attributable to the property tax, the more predictable are actual revenues for the year and the lower is the likelihood of a shortfall relative to the budgeted revenue amount. On the other side of the issue, whereas with respect to alternative sources of revenue such as user fees there may be scope for the individual taxpayer to make choices that affect the amount paid, the amount of the value-based tax levy for a parcel of land is something over which the owner has virtually no control. The objective of Council with respect to the property tax, therefore, is to achieve a balance between the revenue predictability that this source provides on the one hand, and the goal of restraining the growth of the property value-based tax burden on the other. Council policy is to use the property tax levy to balance the expenditure side of the budget for each year after examining the potential for sustainable revenues from all other sources. 1.2 Revenue From Parcel Taxes - Objectives and Policies A parcel tax is a tax levy on land, the amount of which is not a function of the assessed value of the land. It can be the same amount for every parcel regardless of size, or it can vary with the area or frontage of a parcel. Only in limited circumstances is a parcel tax an alternative to a property value-based tax. It can only be applied to properties receiving a particular service and cannot be used for the funding of general services. With the property tax taking into account the value of improvements as well as land, there is a higher probability, compared to a parcel tax, that it will be related to ability to pay. The objective of Council with regard to the parcel tax concept is to ensure that its use is fair in light of the actual distribution of the benefits conferred by the service that it is intended to fund. Council policy to date has been to use the parcel tax only to cover part of the cost of maintaining boulevards on a limited number of streets where this service is provided by the Municipality. With the value of the service directly related to the amount of boulevard to be maintained, the parcel tax in this case is based on frontage. 138 2023-2027 Financial Plan 1.3 Revenue From Fees - Objectives and Policies Fees charges for specific services form a large part of the municipal revenue stream, adding approximately another 50% to the amount raised by the property value-based tax levy. The largest component of user fee revenue is that which is generated from the Municipality’s recreation programs. The objective of Council is to ensure that recreation user fee revenues cover all of the direct program costs, and to maximize the coverage of fixed overhead costs as well. Council policy is to review recreation user fees annually, against the backdrop of the regional market. Much smaller than recreation fee revenue, but still significant in terms of the property value-based tax increase that would be required to replace it, is the solid waste collection and disposal charge, which is a fixed amount for each collection unit (e.g., a dwelling unit or small business) served by municipal crews. The principal objective, with respect to the use of a solid waste charge rather than the property value-based tax is to avoid double-charging properties that, due to volume and the nature of the equipment used, must contract privately for solid waste collection services. Council policy is to recover 100% of its solid waste disposal and collection costs through the solid waste fee. The Municipality also operates a water distribution system. Its fiscal objective, with respect to the system, is to cover the associated costs on a user-pay basis, and the policy in this regard is to set water consumption rates and connection fees at a level which achieves this goal without any requirement for subsidization from the property value-based tax. The Municipality’s sewer system is also operated as a utility, which has traditionally been funded through the property value-based tax, with minor contributions from connection fees. With large capital costs forthcoming in order to comply with the Capital Regional District’s Core Area Liquid Waste Management plan, along with the Provincial Municipal Sewage Regulation, Council has set an objective of funding a greater portion of sewer utility costs from user fees. With household water consumption closely tied to capacity requirements in the sewer system, Council has determined to raise 70% of its sewer utility costs from a water consumption-based user fee by policy. 1.4 Revenue From Other Sources - Objectives and Policies Revenue in the “Other Sources” class consists primarily of appropriations from internal municipal reserve funds. The proportion of total revenue from this source will vary significantly from one year to the next. The principal objective with respect to the use of reserve funds is to finance capital asset depreciation and avoid the use of such funds to offset ongoing operating costs. The rationale for this being that the latter would not be sustainable in the long-term, and would eventually require a property value-based tax spike. Council policy is to use its reserve funds to finance capital works which, in the main, are not undertaken by municipal crews and which therefore may increase or decrease in the amount of the expenditure budget that they represent without affecting the permanent workforce. 139 2023-2027 Financial Plan 1.5 Proceeds From Borrowing - Objectives and Policies The objective of Council is to maintain its long-term debt servicing costs at a manageable level by replacing infrastructure on an incremental “pay as you go” basis. Council policy is to limit the creation of long-term debt to the financing of large capital projects, which cannot efficiently be undertaken on an incremental basis, or where such an approach would not be adequate to meet requirements with respect to public safety, health or senior government regulations. The objective for short-term borrowing, (less than 5 years) is to maintain the outstanding debt at a relatively constant level so that with the amortization of the debt on a project so financed, further investments in the assets of the Municipality can be made without tax impact. The amount of short- term debt that can be outstanding at any one time is relatively low—pursuant to the requirements of the Community Charter. Projects funded in this manner therefore tend to be relatively small; alternatively, the short-term debt may represent only part of the overall funding package. 2. Property Value Tax Distribution With non-residential properties representing a very small proportion of the total tax base, taxing other classes at a high multiple of the residential rate would be of relatively small benefit to the homeowner, while imposing a disproportionate burden on business property owners and their commercial tenants. The municipal business tax rate as a multiple of the residential tax rate, therefore, is very low relative to most local governments throughout British Columbia. There is no property in the Industry class, and only a small amount in the Recreation class. The objective of Council is to distribute future property value tax increases equitably among the three main classes of property within the Municipality. The policy is to adjust the tax rate ratios each year so that the increase on the average individual property is approximately the same for each of the main classes. There is one property in the Farm class. The value of the property, however, is in its residential use, and the policy is to set the Farm tax rate so as to produce for that one property a municipal tax levy comparable to what it would have been had it remained in the Residential class and increased in assessed value at a rate comparable to other residential properties in its immediate neighbourhood. 3. Permissive Tax Exemptions The objective being to distribute the tax burden fairly among properties receiving municipal services, Council makes very little use of its authority to grant permissive tax exemptions. The policy to date has been to grant permissive exemptions for land and improvements appurtenant to property already exempted by statute (e.g., churches). These exemptions have also been extended to portions of municipal land leased, or licensed to a non-profit organization providing a service complementary to municipal services, and in one case, an institution of childhood learning not statutorily exempt. 140 2023-2027 Financial Plan Appendix D: 2020 - 2023 Consolidated Budgets and Actuals (Unaudited) 141 2023-2027 Financial Plan
